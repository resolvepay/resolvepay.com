In exchange for\n                and conditioned upon the Assignment of Indebtedness and the\n                Advance Fees (as defined below), Resolve will provide an Advance\n                (as defined below) from the sale.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <span>Payments.</span>\n                <ol type=\"i\">\n                  <li>\n                    When a Successful Transaction is Captured (as defined below)\n                    through the Advance Services, Resolve shall remit payment\n                    (the \"<strong>Advance</strong>\") to the Merchant in\n                    accordance with the terms of this Advance Agreement. The\n                    amount of the Advance shall be equal to the value of the\n                    Successful Transaction multiplied by the Advance Rate (as\n                    defined below).\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Once the Customer pays Resolve for the full value of a\n                    Successful Transaction, Resolve will remit payment to the\n                    Merchant for the difference of the full value of that\n                    Successful Transaction and the Advance for that Successful\n                    Transaction (the \"<strong>Balance</strong>\"). In the event\n                    the Customer pays Resolve less than the full value of a\n                    Successful Transaction, but more than the Advance for that\n                    Successful Transaction, Resolve shall remit payment to the\n                    Merchant for the difference of the amount actually received\n                    by Resolve and the Advance. In the event the Customer pays\n                    Resolve less than the Advance, then Resolve has no\n                    obligation to pay Merchant any additional amounts.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    If Merchant receives payment directly from a Customer for a\n                    Successful Transaction that was processed with the Advance\n                    Services, Merchant must notify Resolve immediately so that\n                    Resolve can debit Merchant for repayment of the Advance.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section\n                    5(c), all payments to Merchant by Resolve are subject to\n                    reduction or offset as set forth in this Advance Agreement.\n                  </li>\n                </ol>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <span>Fees.</span>\n                <ol type=\"i\">\n                  <li>\n                    The \"<strong>Advance Fees</strong>\" are equal to (x) the\n                    percentage set forth beside the Trade Credit Terms on the\n                    Order Form, multiplied by (y) the applicable Advance Rate,\n                    multiplied by (z) the gross dollar amount of sales that are\n                    (a) approved by Resolve and (b) Captured by Merchant (\"\n                    <strong>Successful Transactions</strong>\"). Resolve will\n                    assign each Customer an \"<strong>Advance Rate</strong>\",\n                    depending on the Customer's credit quality and other risk\n                    attributes. A sale is \"<strong>Captured</strong>\" by\n                    Merchant (i.e., Merchant becomes entitled to payment of the\n                    Advance) when Merchant: (1) acknowledges to Resolve that a\n                    pending credit transaction with a Customer was created\n                    through the Resolve platform; (2) agrees to fulfill the\n                    pending transaction; and (3) ships the goods or provides or\n                    otherwise makes the goods or services available to the\n                    Customer. \"<strong>Order Form</strong>\" means the online or\n                    written form between Resolve and Merchant evidencing the\n                    initial subscription for the Advance Services approved by\n                    Merchant and any subsequent Order Forms submitted\n                    thereafter. Resolve reserves the right to revise the Fees at\n                    any time upon providing thirty (30) days' prior written\n                    notice to Merchant.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Merchant shall pay to Resolve the Advance Fees, which may be\n                    credited by Resolve against any amounts payable to Merchant.\n                    All Advance Fees are due immediately, except as otherwise\n                    expressly noted herein.

Resolve may revise its billing procedures at its\n                    sole discretion with 30-day prior written notice to\n                    Merchant.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Merchant may not impose on a Customer any surcharge or fee\n                    for use of the Advance Services greater than similar fees\n                    for other payment methods that Merchant supports.\n                  </li>\n                </ol>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <span>Returned Merchandise; Refunds.</span> Subject to the CDRP,\n                Resolve shall not hold Customer liable for any amount arising\n                from Customer's purchase if Customer provides Resolve with\n                reasonably detailed documentary evidence showing that the\n                product in question was returned to Merchant in accordance with\n                Merchant's stated return policy.

In the case of partial\n                refunds, Merchant shall be solely responsible for determining\n                the amount of such refund and liable for any dispute with a\n                Customer relating thereto.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <span>Payment Schedule.</span>\n                <ol type=\"i\">\n                  <li>\n                    (i) Once the Bank Account information has been reviewed and\n                    verified by Resolve, subject to the terms hereof, Resolve\n                    will begin making periodic payments to Merchant.
