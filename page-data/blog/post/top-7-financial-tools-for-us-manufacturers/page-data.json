Payroll management</h3>\n<p>A company like Walmart employs 2.3 million workers. Preparing and reconciling the payroll can’t be a fun job. Thankfully, plenty of payroll management software makes the process bearable.</p>\n<p>Take QuickBooks Payroll, for instance. It is a cloud-based payroll software that enables you to pay employees, manage employee benefits, and file income taxes. It even throws in human resource management capabilities in there as well.</p>\n<p>This software allows you to create paychecks complete with automatic tax calculations and e-filing. You also get automatic tax withdrawal to avoid lump sum tax bills. Payroll allows you the option of directly depositing employees’ payroll to their checking or savings account.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-manufacturing-business-intelligence\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#7-manufacturing-business-intelligence\" aria-label=\"7 manufacturing business intelligence permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>7. Manufacturing business intelligence</h3>\n<p>According to a Deloitte survey,<a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/cn/en/pages/consumer-industrial-products/articles/ai-manufacturing-application-survey.html\"> 93% of manufacturing companies believe AI will drive innovation</a> in the industry. One such use case is in Manufacturing Business Intelligence (BI), where the software will retrieve data, analyze it, and present it in an easily digestible format.</p>\n<p>Sisense is a fine example of BI software that can access and simplify cloud data. It harnesses the power of AI to create relevant business trends from a ton of what would otherwise be incoherent datasets.
