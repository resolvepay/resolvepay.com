While some are obviously more popular than others, accepting a wide range of payments will do more to <strong>help</strong> your business than hurt it.</p>\n<p>A common myth about accepting multiple forms of payments is that it can quickly get costly and hard to track. However, this couldn’t be farther from the truth. With many alternative forms of payment, you only <strong>pay when your customer uses it.</strong> In other words, if nobody’s using a certain form of payment, it’s not costing you anything. Acknowledging facts like this will lead to a fruitful business for years to come! Below are even more reasons why accepting multiple forms of payment is ideal for your business.</p>\n<h2 id=\"increased-independence\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#increased-independence\" aria-label=\"increased independence permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Increased Independence</h2>\n<p>Relying on one form of payment could spell trouble for your business in the event of technical difficulties from your payment provider. While the United States’ banking system and similar state-run banks abroad are quite secure institutions because of their oversight, many online payment methods such as PayPal do not fall under the same legal guidelines. In the event of an unfortunate tech crash, relying on one form of payment can spell trouble for your brand when attempting to close sales.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attract-customers\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#attract-customers\" aria-label=\"attract customers permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Attract Customers</h2>\n<p>The 2000’s eCommerce boom was sparked primarily due to a growing desire for convenience, as the internet’s capabilities were starting to become clearer.
