This includes parts, engineering, design, and shareholder profit.</p>\n<p>However, the lighting industry supply chain has seen significant supply chain disruptions that we expect to continue. Our discussion is primarily focused on LED lighting. The DOE report notes that in 2018, LED market penetration exceeded 50% for outdoor lighting, and by 2035, 84% of all lighting sales are predicted to be LEDs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"global-nature-of-supply-chain-and-concentration-of-inputs-coming-from-asia\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#global-nature-of-supply-chain-and-concentration-of-inputs-coming-from-asia\" aria-label=\"global nature of supply chain and concentration of inputs coming from asia permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Global nature of supply chain and concentration of inputs coming from Asia</h2>\n<p>Because of the extensive components and production methods needed to produce LED lamps and luminaires, the supply chain really does span the globe. After acquiring supplies, the process involves driver manufacturing, LED luminaire manufacturing, LED package manufacturing, and LED die manufacturing. Every process (and even parts of a single process) may occur at different facilities in different countries.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/x72jfbsnccq4/5lQFABxpIPutIiSB1YlMAf/03ce19428bb618ba93e54c135e978625/Prominent_Manufacturers_in_the_LED_Supply_Chain.PNG\" alt=\"Prominent Manufacturers in the LED Supply Chain\"></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/ssl-2020-led-mfg-supply-chain-mar21.pdf\">https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/ssl-2020-led-mfg-supply-chain-mar21.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Asia remains a key source for LED die and package manufacturing because its manufacturing costs are much lower than in other places. Specifically, China is a dominant source for LED packaging, and almost all epitaxy and wafer fabrication occurs in Asia.</p>\n<p>But, it’s not all concentrated in Asia. In 2019, 21% of LED luminaire imports to the US were from Mexico.

At the end of September 2021, there were over 60 container ships waiting off the coast of Los Angeles. Delays are slowing the movement of both components and LED fixtures. There will continue to be negative impacts to the entire supply chain as a result.</p>\n<p>While large retailers like Costco and The Home Depot are getting around some delays by contracting their own vessels, most businesses can’t access this type of workaround. Plus, <strong>the average cost of a container has increased 4x in 2021.</strong></p>\n<p>The American Lighting Association—along with other organizations—is pushing for new legislation around this. Changes might include regulations on ocean carriers, more oversight by the Federal Maritime Commission, minimum service standards, and moving the burden of proof for late fees to carriers (and away from companies placing orders). These changes may eventually improve supply chains, but progress remains distant.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trade-relations\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#trade-relations\" aria-label=\"trade relations permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Trade relations</h3>\n<p>We’re still seeing the impact of the previous administration’s tariffs on Chinese products. Generally, the increased costs from tariffs were passed down to American customers. Further, additional manufacturing has been offshored from the US to Mexico, but perhaps the biggest impact was the movement of production lines out of China and into countries like Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>\n<h3 id=\"materials-and-labor-availability\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#materials-and-labor-availability\" aria-label=\"materials and labor availability permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Materials and labor availability</h3>\n<p>One of the primary drivers of shipping delays is labor shortages. In the summer of 2021, the Port of Oakland eliminated its backlog by hiring hundreds of additional workers. However, when containers do finally clear the port, their contents still need to be transported over land—another place where labor shortages are slowing down the supply chain.</p>\n<p>We are seeing this play out at the Port of Los Angeles, where as of October 2021, there is a 2 week backlog of shipping containers waiting to access the port. While there are plenty of longshore workers available to unload the shipping containers, a shortage of truck drivers is creating a substantial chokepoint, which is expected to cause delays through the end of the year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"supply-chains-effect-on-cash-flow\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#supply-chains-effect-on-cash-flow\" aria-label=\"supply chains effect on cash flow permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Supply chain’s effect on cash flow</h2>\n<p>As we’ve seen in the past 2 years, these variables cumulatively snowball and have a huge impact on costs and lead times.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cost-and-time-impacts\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#cost-and-time-impacts\" aria-label=\"cost and time impacts permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Cost and time impacts</h3>\n<p>Reduced supply causes input prices to go up, putting a squeeze on margins and making cash flow of even greater importance.</p>\n<p>Long lead times for products and inputs mean (of course) longer order fulfillment times.
