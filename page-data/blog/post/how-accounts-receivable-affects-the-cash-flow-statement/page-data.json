So, how do you prove your business’ liquidity? That’s where CFS’ come in handy as they show the exact position of your company’s cash flow.</li>\n<li>Go into details about the changes in assets, liabilities, and equity in the form of cash balance, cash inflows, and cash outflows. These three form the accounting equation, helping you measure business performance.</li>\n<li>It makes it easier for investors to compare your business’s performance to others. For instance, one firm might be using accrual basis accounting while another uses cash basis; CFS provides a level field that eliminates the effects of these different bookkeeping techniques.</li>\n<li>A CFS can help predict future cash flows as you can create cash flow  projections by planning how much liquidity you expect in the future, vital for long-term business plans.</li>\n<li>The only way you can secure a loan or line of credit is by keeping your CFS up-to-date. </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"positive-cash-flow-vs-negative-cash-flow\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#positive-cash-flow-vs-negative-cash-flow\" aria-label=\"positive cash flow vs negative cash flow permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Positive cash flow vs. negative cash flow</h2>\n<p>When your CFS has a negative number, that usually means you lost money during that accounting period. However, just because you have a negative number does not mean you panic. </p>\n<p>A negative balance doesn’t always spell doom and gloom. Sometimes you might decide to spend more cash than usual in the hope of future returns, such as investing in office equipment.</p>\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/17/netflix-free-cash-flow-q3-2018-negative-859-million.html\">Netflix racked up negative cash flows</a> for years as it increased spending to come up with compelling content against its competitors, with the gamble paying off handsomely.</p>\n<p>Generally, a positive cash flow indicates you have a healthy business. In the long run, it isn’t always a cause for popping champagne. While it may mean the business is currently liquid, a positive cash flow may have been a result of taking out a loan to keep the business afloat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-do-the-cash-flow-statements-come-from\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#where-do-the-cash-flow-statements-come-from\" aria-label=\"where do the cash flow statements come from permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Where do the cash flow statements come from?</h2>\n<p>If you are starting out, you can do the bookkeeping in Excel, with the income statement and balance sheets helping you calculate the CFS.</p>\n<p>Once you advance, you could use the information entered in the general ledger to automate the CFS-making process using accounting software.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x72jfbsnccq4/5T8C9U25vXPRxicwVKMyin/985e5339b3aab15b3f28a00feb7d5392/AdobeStock_276566021.jpeg\" alt=\"Businessman or analyst holding calculator while reviewing financial statements for business performance or cash flow analysis\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-calculate-cash-flow\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-to-calculate-cash-flow\" aria-label=\"how to calculate cash flow permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How to calculate cash flow</h2>\n<p>There are two main methods of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that can help you develop a CFS:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Direct method</strong></p>\n<p>It refers to cash-basis accounting as you record every transaction whenever you receive or disburse cash, only bringing it up when preparing the CFS at the end of the month.</p>\n<p>As you can tell, it takes more effort since you need to track every cash transaction, and then subtract cash flow from the inflow. That includes items such as cash receipts, interest received, and income tax payments.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Indirect method</strong></p>\n<p>Small businesses prefer this method to track cash received and cash payments from the business. They can record transactions whenever they accrue, rather than when cash changes hands, a method known as accrual accounting.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, that means you’d have to go back to the income statement to eliminate transactions that do not reflect cash transfers. It may seem tedious, but the upshot is you don’t have to go back to reconcile your statements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-in-a-cash-flow-statement\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-is-in-a-cash-flow-statement\" aria-label=\"what is in a cash flow statement permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What is in a Cash Flow Statement?</h2>\n<p>A CFS is different from the other financial statements as it has three main sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Cash flow from operations:</strong> contains data on incoming cash from current          assets and current liabilities, including all operational business                activities such as salaries, and buying and selling inventory.</li>\n<li><strong>Cash flow from investing activities:</strong> shows your investment losses and          gains. An analyst can use this to work out the capital expenditure (CapEx)        changes. For example, it includes transactions like mergers and                  acquisitions, or purchasing equipment.</li>\n<li><strong>Cash provided by financing activities:</strong> is cash spent or earned through          financing with loans, owner’s equity, or lines of credit. Briefly, it            reveals the cash flow between you, your business, and its creditors from          raising money from debt, stock, or debt amortization. After you’re done          with all the calculations, you will be left with the net cash flow.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The CFS may also include non-cash items such as obsolescence and depreciation expenses. Depreciation and amortization reduce net income in the income statement, although you add them back to the CFS as they are non-cash expenses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accounts-receivable-and-account-payable\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#accounts-receivable-and-account-payable\" aria-label=\"accounts receivable and account payable permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Accounts receivable and account payable</h2>\n<p>It’s tempting to label cash flow as ‘cash in’ or ‘cash out,’ but the way a business uses its cash or receives it is more nuanced than that, necessitating the preparation of accounts receivable and accounts payable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accounts-payable-effect-on-cash-flow\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#accounts-payable-effect-on-cash-flow\" aria-label=\"accounts payable effect on cash flow permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Accounts payable effect on cash flow</h2>\n<p>When a company purchases supplies, it may not necessarily pay straight away.

Allowing a customer some time before they pay is an account receivable.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you make a sale of $10,000 with terms of sale at 50% cash and 50% credit payable within 60 days, record the $5,000 as sales since it is a cash inflow. You will record the balance as an inflow when it is paid.</p>\n<p>Here, Resolve can come in handy to <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/accounts-receivable/\">enhance your accounts receivable.</a> Did you know that Resolve makes net terms risk-free?
