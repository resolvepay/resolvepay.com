Or you can also say the average number of days to collect on invoices outstanding. Basically, DSO answers the question, how long does it take for customers to pay you?</p>\n<p>In most industries, customers receive some grace period. It might be 10, 15, 30, 60, or 90 days (i.e., net terms). Customers will pay around the due date with some paying sooner, some later, and some on the date. This creates an average called DSO.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-days-sales-outstanding-formula\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-is-the-days-sales-outstanding-formula\" aria-label=\"what is the days sales outstanding formula permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What is the days sales outstanding formula?</h2>\n<p>The days sales outstanding formula is calculated by:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>*[Accounts receivable balance (average)] / [annual credit revenue] x 360</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the accounts receivable (AR) average increases but sales remain the same, DSO will also increase and vice versa.

But it's important to know which are faster moving and what their impact on the business might be. DSO isn’t a fast-moving metric since its trend is only realized over time. But it isn’t exactly slow either as a trend can be seen in only a few weeks to a month. Below are a few reasons why it's important to keep an eye on your DSO trend.</p>\n<h3 id=\"avoid-cash-flow-issues\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#avoid-cash-flow-issues\" aria-label=\"avoid cash flow issues permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Avoid cash flow issues</h3>\n<p>There is a direct relationship between DSO and cash flow. As DSO goes down, the company takes in more cash through customer payments since customers are decreasing their average time to pay. </p>\n<p>When DSO increases, customers hold onto their payments longer. This can create a cash flow crunch where money going out (to pay vendors/suppliers) is not being replenished fast enough by money coming in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"generate-more-revenue\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#generate-more-revenue\" aria-label=\"generate more revenue permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Generate more revenue</h3>\n<p>By tracking and minimizing DSO, thus increasing cash on hand, you can generate more revenue in the future, according to the time value of money. </p>\n<h3 id=\"improve-customer-satisfaction\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#improve-customer-satisfaction\" aria-label=\"improve customer satisfaction permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Improve customer satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Tracking DSO helps shed insight into how happy customers are with your product. This assumes customers pay sooner because of overall satisfaction with the company or product. </p>\n<p>DSO may also decrease because of discounts customers receive for paying earlier — another form of customer satisfaction. For example, a 2/10 net 30 invoice means the customer will receive a 2% discount if they pay within 10 days. Else, they have 30 days to pay. If your discounting methods are effective, customers are expressing satisfaction with the discounts offered by taking advantage of them. These quicker payments can have an overall positive impact on DSO (by decreasing it). </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-interpret-dso\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-to-interpret-dso\" aria-label=\"how to interpret dso permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How to interpret DSO</h2>\n<p>The direction that DSO is moving says a lot about your collections process and the effect any improvements in DSO are having.
