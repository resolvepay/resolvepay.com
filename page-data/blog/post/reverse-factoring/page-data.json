In that case, you will request your financier to make early payments on approved invoices to a supplier, on condition that you will pay the finance provider when the invoices/open receivables are due. The best solution however is not factoring, <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/\">Resolve</a> is known as ‘modern factoring’ and is safer and better for your reputation than factoring. See, <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/blog/post/8-reasons-why-resolve-is-better-than-invoice-factoring/\">8 Reasons Resolve is Better Than Factoring</a>. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-reverse-factoring-work\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-does-reverse-factoring-work\" aria-label=\"how does reverse factoring work permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How does reverse factoring work?</h2>\n<p>Reverse factoring derives its name from conventional factoring. Unlike factoring, where the seller asks an invoice factoring company for finance, the purchaser initiates the funding request, hence the term reverse factoring.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, the lender will consider the buyer’s creditworthiness rather than the supplier’s credit rating when deciding to extend funding.</p>\n<p>Typically, reverse factoring will carry lower costs than if the supplier were to seek funding on their own. That’s because banks generally only extend such terms to large companies, such as an enterprise venture. To lenders, these entities represent low credit risk, hence the predictably favorable terms.</p>\n<p>That said, this is how the financing method usually works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The buyer purchases services or goods from a supplier on credit</li>\n<li>The supplier will start the reverse factoring process by forwarding the invoice to the factoring platform, clearly stating the amount and payment dates</li>\n<li>The buyer will acknowledge receiving the goods and approve the invoice</li>\n<li>The supplier will request payment</li>\n<li>The reverse factoring company will send the supplier the invoice amount payment, less factoring fees</li>\n<li>On the invoice maturity date, the buyer will send payment to the funder</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do keep in mind the accounting treatment of reverse factoring. You should classify the program not as a bank loan but rather as an off-balance sheet solution.</p>\n<p>The whole goal of reverse factoring arrangements is to reduce the time between accounts receivable payments, thereby improving cash flow, and that is where the factoring alternative called <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/\">Resolve</a> shines through. Resolve offers a complete net terms and credit management solution that takes care of everything needed to provide credit terms.</p>\n<p>With Resolve, you don’t even need to fill in a form, but they will approve <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/net-terms/\">net terms and credit limits</a> within 24 hours.
