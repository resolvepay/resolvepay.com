However, your business will encounter challenges and roadblocks along the way, despite the success. In fact, a few profitable businesses face issues with cash flow. Poor cash flow is a result of inefficiency, which is a sign that your operations are not running smoothly and that there is room for improvement.</p>\n<p>In most cases, businesses face <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/blog/post/how-accounts-receivable-affects-the-cash-flow-statement/\">cash flow problems</a> when they fail to recover receivables from clients. This simply means that your business will not have the cash to pay bills on time, which can lead to further problems. Over time, your business’ creditworthiness comes under a cloud, which is not good for your business in the long run.</p>\n<p>That is to say, it is substantially important for businesses to implement smart strategies that cannot only keep their cash flow running positively, but also improve it. Here are a few ideas that you can consider:  </p>\n<h2 id=\"opt-for-leasing-dont-buy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#opt-for-leasing-dont-buy\" aria-label=\"opt for leasing dont buy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Opt for leasing, don’t buy</h2>\n<p>For some businesses, this may sound bizarre because leasing equipment or supplies is sometimes more expensive than purchasing. For businesses that only focus on their bottom line, leasing seems counter-intuitive.  </p>\n<p>However, purchasing supplies is only beneficial when your business enjoys timely receipts and you have enough finances to maintain day-to-day cash streams for operations.</p>\n<p>If this is not the case, your company may face serious cash flow problems in the future. This is when paying your due cash in the form of small increments can help you not only maintain the cash flow, but also improve it. Not only this, you can write off the lease payments because they are a business expense.</p>\n<h2 id=\"offer-discounts-on-payments\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#offer-discounts-on-payments\" aria-label=\"offer discounts on payments permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Offer discounts on payments</h2>\n<p>This is another option that can be tremendously advantageous when it comes to improving your cash flow.  That is, everyone likes incentives, especially customers. Offering your customers discount deals, that not only grabs their attention but also urges them to pay their bills on time, can be a WIN/WIN situation for your business.</p>\n<p>This is one of the simplest ways you can keep your cash flow running.</p>\n<h2 id=\"take-credit\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#take-credit\" aria-label=\"take credit permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Take credit</h2>\n<p>This one is extremely important if you deal with customers who do not like paying in cash. In situations like these, make sure you conduct credit checks, especially before they sign necessary paperwork.</p>\n<p>It is a convenient way to determine whether a customer has sufficient credit to make the payments, or not. If he/she has poor credit, it is an indication that you will not receive timely payments. There is no doubt that your business needs sales, but it is equally important to consider that it might disrupt the cash flow of your business if your customers don’t pay on time.</p>\n<p>So, if you decide to sell to customers who have questionable credit, make sure that you set up an interest rate that can secure your payment in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pool-with-other-companies\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#pool-with-other-companies\" aria-label=\"pool with other companies permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Pool with other companies</h2>\n<p>The greater the number of buying companies, the greater the discount they will get.
