Paying for the product or service is a critical part of establishing a good trade reference. The process of establishing trade references is similar to building personal credit. This means a supplier you've made no late payments to.</p>\n<p>Not all businesses can be a trade reference. You’ll quickly find this out when you fill out an application for a loan or credit. What’s considered a trade reference is completely up to the business approving your application. In some cases, utilities aren’t considered trade references. A small business or startup are not always the best references either.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-suppliers-can-avoid-checking-trade-references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-suppliers-can-avoid-checking-trade-references\" aria-label=\"how suppliers can avoid checking trade references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How suppliers can avoid checking trade references</h2>\n<p>As a supplier, managing the credit checking process costs your AR team a lot of time.

Floating net terms credit ties up cash flow and there's still a risk of non-payment.

When you apply for credit terms with a new supplier, the supplier may call your trade references directly, while another supplier decides to use credit reporting agencies such as a <a href=\"https://businesscredit.dnb.com/\">Dun &#x26; Bradstreet (D&#x26;B) business credit report</a>, experian, or equifax to view credit ratings. These can cost between $50 - $150 USD, so you can see why it's easier to check trade references. </p>\n<h4 id=\"1-build-relationships-with-suppliersvendors\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#1-build-relationships-with-suppliersvendors\" aria-label=\"1 build relationships with suppliersvendors permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>1. Build relationships with suppliers/vendors</h4>\n<p>If you're a new client, it's a great idea to build business relationships with your suppliers. The more a supplier or vendor knows you, the more likely they are to become a trade reference. They'll be happy to give you a reference letter when another company asks for a trade reference request. Building a relationship means working with suppliers and vendors on a consistent basis, not just once or twice. You begin to rely on them and they on you. That is where the real relationship begins. Just like any good personal relationship, the two of you build trust.\nAs you can imagine, building such relationships takes time. That’s just another way of saying that building trade references takes time. If someone is going to allow you to list them as a trade reference, they want to know you’re credible and that your business is reliable. Gatting 30 day or 60 day net terms from a supplier is much easier than using a business loan to help your cash flow.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2-make-payments-on-time\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#2-make-payments-on-time\" aria-label=\"2 make payments on time permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. Make payments on time</h4>\n<p>In addition to building trust, it’s critical always to pay your supplier and vendor bills on time. If you can pay a little earlier, that’s even better. In some cases, you might not have as many interactions with a vendor. Transactions may take place mostly online, which doesn’t really leave any room for personal interaction. You want to keep your credit account with suppliers in a good place.</p>\n<p>However, consistently paying on time will speak volumes to your credibility and will carry a lot of weight. At some point, you might miss a payment due to something outside of your control. If you have a stellar payment history, one missed payment is not likely to damage your relationship with that particular supplier or vendor. </p>\n<h4 id=\"3-request-that-suppliersvendors-submit-to-db\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#3-request-that-suppliersvendors-submit-to-db\" aria-label=\"3 request that suppliersvendors submit to db permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. Request that suppliers/vendors submit to D&#x26;B</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dnb.com/\">Dun &#x26; Bradstreet (D&#x26;B)</a> is similar to a credit bureau for businesses. When an entity such as a bank, vendor, customer, or insurance company wants to check a business’ credit, D&#x26;B is a great way to do it. Each business that is registered with D&#x26;B gets a DUNS Number, a unique identifying number for a business used only by D&#x26;B.</p>\n<p>Unlike personal credit bureaus, D&#x26;B business credit doesn’t happen automatically. It takes some work. To establish a credit profile with D&#x26;B, you must first register and get a DUNS Number. Then your vendors and suppliers must consistently submit your payment history to D&#x26;B.</p>\n<p>Some businesses automatically submit payment experiences to D&#x26;B. For those that do not, you’ll need to ask them to submit your payment experiences. In some cases, whether or not a  vendor or supplier automatically submits payment experiences to D&#x26;B could be a deciding factor in choosing them.</p>\n<p>Once you have at least three trade references with D&#x26;B, your PAYDEX score can be calculated. The D&#x26;B PAYDEX score is like a personal credit score. A good PAYDEX score can mean lower interest rates, lower premiums, and access to credit lines with suppliers and vendors.</p>\n<p>Establishing trade references can be crucial to the success of your business if credit is important to you. A history of solid payments shows that you are a low credit risk. Companies will be more willing to extend credit to you for this reason. Lack of trade references can mean poorer credit terms and higher interest rates on loans. Looking for a trade reference template? There are many available for free online. </p>\n<h2 id=\"3-benefits-of-having-solid-trade-references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#3-benefits-of-having-solid-trade-references\" aria-label=\"3 benefits of having solid trade references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3 benefits of having solid trade references</h2>\n<p>All the hard work involved with creating trade references must pay off at some point.

But you’ll have to pay for any product or services in full.\nLarger and more reputable businesses have established credit policies and may provide your business with some of the best credit terms available.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-key-components-of-a-trade-reference-submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#7-key-components-of-a-trade-reference-submission\" aria-label=\"7 key components of a trade reference submission permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>7 key components of a trade reference submission</h2>\n<p>Let’s look at the other side of trade references — the vendor or supplier who’s submitting payment experiences.

If you don’t have a payment history because you’re new, no one will extend you credit. But if no one will extend your credit, how do you create a payment history? Seems like a chicken-and-egg problem.</p>\n<p>To get around this dilemma, new businesses must start by paying with cash or using a personal credit card. Once the vendor sees that the new business can pay, it will begin extending credit in small increments. At that point, the new business has established a trade reference. The new business also needs to ensure that the vendor is reporting its payment history to the credit bureaus.</p>\n<p>Establishing trade references is a must for any business that buys on credit or will be applying for a loan. Building up your trade references is not difficult, and, with a little planning, you can be sure you’ll get the most out of your references.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion-on-trade-references\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion-on-trade-references\" aria-label=\"conclusion on trade references permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion on Trade References</h2>\n<p>Just as we should maintain excellent personal credit, business owners should focus on maintaining excellent business credit.
