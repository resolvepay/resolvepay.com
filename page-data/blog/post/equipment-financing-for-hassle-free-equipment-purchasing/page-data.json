While their cost may seem minimal, you will need a lot of the equipment if you are starting a business or you are a supplier, so their cost can quickly add up.</p>\n<p>Paying upfront for the equipment will be out of the question because of the financial strain, which leaves you with one other option: <strong>machinery financing.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s no surprise to the Equipment Leasing and Financing Association (ELFA), as they found that <a href=\"https://www.elfaonline.org/about/industry-overview\">79% of US businesses</a> use leasing or loans to acquire equipment. If you’ve ever wondered what machinery financing is or what it can do for your business, here’s a blow-by-blow analysis of this funding game changer.</p>\n<p>Used interchangeably with equipment financing, it refers to obtaining an equipment loan or equipment leasing funds to secure essential business equipment or machinery.</p>\n<p>You can use the business financing for the equipment lease or for purchasing a physical asset, such as a company car, filing cabinets, or commercial oven. This small business loan is different from <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/blog/post/how-to-beat-cash-flow-shortages-with-heavy-equipment-financing/\">heavy machine financing</a> as that refers to funding for heavy-duty manufacturing equipment or heavy machinery, such as bulldozers and excavators.</p>\n<p>Further, machinery finance provides funding for a physical asset, unlike other forms of financing like working capital loans. That’s because the acquisition serves as the collateral for the loan.</p>\n<p>Machinery financing means funding for any sort of equipment that’s essential to the business. For example, if you work in the IT industry, you can get equipment funding for setting up a data center.</p>\n<p>This financing solution ensures you get all the machinery or equipment you need to keep your business running without having to pay a hefty upfront, causing cash flow challenges.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/x72jfbsnccq4/1qXJOvaGKWv9BFNPJ4WALv/d93752e93b1693ad040ccc3330764f85/AdobeStock_123020548.jpeg\" alt=\"office\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"type-of-equipment-or-machinery-covered-by-equipment-financing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#type-of-equipment-or-machinery-covered-by-equipment-financing\" aria-label=\"type of equipment or machinery covered by equipment financing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Type of equipment or machinery covered by equipment financing</h2>\n<p>These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Office furniture</li>\n<li>Vehicles</li>\n<li>IT apparatus</li>\n<li>Farm machinery</li>\n<li>Medical equipment</li>\n<li>Commercial kitchen tools</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-get-equipment-finance\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#where-to-get-equipment-finance\" aria-label=\"where to get equipment finance permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Where to get equipment finance</h2>\n<p><strong>Conventional financing:</strong> The most common typing of equipment financing comes from traditional lenders. At 43%, ELFA notes that they are the most popular too.</p>\n<p>If you have dealt with conventional lenders, you are familiar with their stringent lending terms, and it’s on full display with machinery financing.</p>\n<p>A machinery financing company will often expect a borrower to have impeccable credit ratings and exceptional financial statements. Consequently, these types of loans are more suited to established businesses. The great thing about them is their competitive rates and favorable loan terms.</p>\n<p>After assessing their business needs, the most popular equipment financing options business owners should consider are short-term loans, business term loans, and business credit cards.</p>\n<p>Whatever their choice, the loan will be for a fixed period, with fixed interest rates, and will involve periodic repayments, typically monthly payments.</p>\n<p><strong>Online lenders:</strong> Are more liberal in their approach to credit scores and business track records. Therefore, their business model is riskier, explaining why they have less favorable loan terms and interest rates.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, their loan application process is shorter and less taxing, while the time between loan application and loan disbursement is likely to take less than three business days.</p>\n<p><strong>Hot tip:</strong> the loan and repayments terms will depend on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>State of the equipment or machinery</li>\n<li>Your creditworthiness</li>\n<li>How long you have been in business</li>\n<li>Number of years you want to repay the loan</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you seek to buy/lease new equipment or machinery, it will have a longer lifespan than used equipment. As a result, you should expect extended repayment periods and significant loan amounts.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you have been in business for long and have good credit, you are likely to get better terms and competitive interest rates than someone with a bad credit history. Just note that the loan or leasing options will not be longer than the expected lifespan of the equipment or machinery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-best-alternative-to-equipment-financing-digital-net-terms\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-best-alternative-to-equipment-financing-digital-net-terms\" aria-label=\"the best alternative to equipment financing digital net terms permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The best alternative to equipment financing ‘digital net terms’</h2>\n<p>If you are a supplier of machinery and equipment, then you understand how expensive it can get. Most businesses are unlikely to have the cash to pay for the equipment upfront. That means the customers purchasing your equipment expect to pay on 30 day or 60 day net terms.</p>\n<p>If you don’t offer net terms, it will likely hurt your sales and your customers will use a supplier who does offer net terms. Floating net terms yourself can put a massive strain on cash flow, you need to keep on restocking, yet there’s a time gap where no money is flowing into the business.</p>\n<p>One of the best ways to mitigate the cash crunch is using Resolve, a net terms and credit management solution.</p>\n<p>Resolve offers accounts receivables service where you can leverage your unpaid net terms invoices for advance payments within 1 day.
