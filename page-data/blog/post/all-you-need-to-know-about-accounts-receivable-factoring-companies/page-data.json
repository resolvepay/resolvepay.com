After that, you will make regular monthly payments like any other bank loan, and you are free to collect the invoice amount from the customer.  </p>\n<p>As for invoice factoring, you sell the invoice for a cash advance at a discount and wash your hands off that invoice.

That might not be ideal, but instant cash can help boost cash flow whenever needed.</p>\n<p>For instance, you may sell goods worth $100,000 to a customer, payable after 60 days. If you must pay one of your suppliers $60,000 after 30 days and you have no cash when it is due, you might sell the $100,000 invoice to a factor for $95,000.

However, spot factoring usually carries higher factor fees.</p>\n<p>Contract factoring means tying down your invoices to a factoring company for an extended period. You will sign a long-term contract, which is usually at least six months long, requiring you to sell several invoices each month to the factor.</p>\n<p>Although the factoring fees will be lower, the contract compels you to send a set monthly minimum volume of invoices. There will be a penalty if you do not meet this target or if you decide to end the contract earlier than expected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"d-recourse-vs-non-recourse-factoring\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#d-recourse-vs-non-recourse-factoring\" aria-label=\"d recourse vs non recourse factoring permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>d. Recourse vs. non-recourse factoring</h3>\n<p>Another feature to consider is recourse or non-recourse, and like spot and contract factoring, will considerably determine your factoring costs.</p>\n<p>You would think that since accounts receivable refers to selling an invoice to the factoring company and once you have received payment that is the end of your liability, but that is far from what it means.</p>\n<p>Generally, you would still be liable for non-payment of that invoice unless under particular circumstances.</p>\n<p>The above scenario highlights what happens in full recourse factoring. If your client is late or does not pay, you will pay the factor’s total fees plus any unrecovered amounts. Since the factor has the added safety of your commitment to pay them if the client fails to, the costs in recourse factoring are lower.</p>\n<p>As for non-recourse, the burden of following up on payment rests with the factor as they cannot ask you to pay late or unpaid invoices. Since it is such a risky venture, the factoring fees will be higher than full recourse factoring.</p>\n<p>However, this is not an absolute cover, as most non-recourse contracts will have you pay if the customer defaults, unless they go bankrupt or undergo closure.</p>\n<p>Whatever your choice, it is in your best interest to ensure you send customers with a good credit history to the accounts receivable factoring company.</p>\n<h3 id=\"e-eligibility-requirements\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#e-eligibility-requirements\" aria-label=\"e eligibility requirements permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>e. Eligibility requirements</h3>\n<p>You want a factor that will not have such strict admissibility requirements since the essential aspect of the agreement is the customer’s credit score.</p>\n<h3 id=\"f-customer-service\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#f-customer-service\" aria-label=\"f customer service permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>f. Customer service</h3>\n<p>Go for an invoice factoring service company with an excellent customer service track record. That entails services such as a local branch, dedicated account manager, phone, email, and live chat options on their website. These options should enable easy contact with your provider whenever you have concerns about the service.</p>\n<p>One of the best alternatives to invoice factoring companies is <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/accounts-receivable/\">Resolve</a>.

Invoice factoring is as simple as an online application, often getting approval and disbursement of the cash within two business days.</li>\n<li><strong>Quick cash:</strong> To stay competitive, industry-wide practices may force you to agree to 30, 60, 90 net term periods before payment. One way around this is using factors to get cash fast. That can help you settle payroll or pay supplies vendors.</li>\n<li><strong>No collateral:</strong> unlike a bank loan line of credit, you don’t need collateral to qualify for factoring.</li>\n<li><strong>Saves time:</strong> since you get your money instantly, you won’t spend time chasing after payments, time you can better spend towards developing your business.</li>\n<li><strong>Prior financial status does not matter:</strong> you need impeccable personal credit scores to qualify for a conventional loan; that’s not the case with invoice factoring. Even if you have a terrible credit history, what matters to a factoring company is if your customers are creditworthy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x72jfbsnccq4/2maNrScWQBNtI16fjIW5Xf/f0c5da7cb784f2aef9805de4a9e7a37e/AdobeStock_288647314.jpeg\" alt=\"Business team celebrating a triumph \"></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-resolve-has-the-best-solution-instead-of-accounts-receivable-factoring\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-resolve-has-the-best-solution-instead-of-accounts-receivable-factoring\" aria-label=\"why resolve has the best solution instead of accounts receivable factoring permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why Resolve has the best solution instead of accounts receivable factoring</h2>\n<p>If you thought the run-of-the-mill factoring companies are fantastic, wait till you read Resolve’s proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Faster cash flow unlocks:</strong> while most factoring companies will process and release the cash 48 hours after invoice approval, Resolve Pay’s same-day funding cuts that down to 24 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Quicker credit checks:</strong> the hold up before releasing cash is because of customer credit checks, which Resolve has mastered. Not only do they offer <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/business-credit-check/\">free credit checks</a>, once they approve a customer, Resolve Pay will advance up to 90% of any subsequent invoices until you hit that customer’s credit limit.</li>\n<li><strong>Reasonable fees:</strong> most factoring companies carry hidden costs and exorbitant factoring rates, typically running between 20-40% of the invoice value. Resolve has a fixed rate of 2.61%. What’s more, they only charge you for the amount you borrow for an invoice. For instance, from a $1,000 invoice, you might only borrow $500. Resolve will only charge interest on the $500 you borrowed. Other factors would still charge you on the full $1,000, even though they only advanced $500.</li>\n<li><strong>Assumes risk of non-payment:</strong> The Company offers non-recourse factoring, which means they assume the credit risk if the customer goes bust or fails to pay.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparent charges:</strong> apart from displaying the charges on the website, Resolve has a simple flat-fee advance rate of 2.61% for a 30-day net term invoice and 90% advance.</li>\n<li><strong>Does all the heavy lifting:</strong> <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/\">Resolve</a>’s accounting software will conduct the customer credit checks, handle net term allocations, process cash payments, follow up on payments, and integrate back office support. That frees up valuable time and resources to get back to growing your business.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To sum up, if you need to get yourself out of a cash crunch, using a more modern solution (i.e. Resolve) to an accounts receivable factoring company is a practical option.
