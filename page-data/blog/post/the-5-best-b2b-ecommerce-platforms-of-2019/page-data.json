The website host you choose with which to start your online business will have a massive effect on your sales, operational abilities, and how your brand is viewed both online and offline. When running a successful B2B business in 2019, these are a few eCommerce solutions to consider.</p><h2>Magento</h2><p>For years, Magento has been an industry leader in the B2B eCommerce space, with a number of robust functions available for the small-business owner. For the price conscious, its platform is available to download <b>completely free of charge</b> through Magento Open Source.

Don’t let this fool you, though, WooCommerce has the ability to transform your ordinary website into a beautiful and powerfully integrated online store. This eCommerce solution is free for personal and commercial use, but one must include a plethora of additional costs that come standard in most other platforms. Regardless, WooCommerce is a no-brainer for those already familiar with WordPress and looking to upgrade their site with one simple plugin.</p><h3>Pros:</h3><ul><li><p>Customer and administrator accounts</p></li><li><p>Tons of free and paid themes</p></li><li><p>Large selection of plugins and extensions</p></li></ul><h3>Cons:</h3><ul><li><p>User friendliness could be improved</p></li><li><p>Decentralized support for third-party extensions</p></li><li><p>Maintenance of a WooCommerce store will take some work</p></li></ul><h2>NetSuite</h2><p>NetSuite is a leading business management software company boating over 16,000 customers worldwide. In addition to eCommerce, NetSuite’s services are designed for small- to medium-sized businesses with additional ERP and CRM capabilities. After being acquired by technology leader Oracle in 2016, the now-subsidiary company has continually improved its offerings year after year, without fail.</p><h3>Pros:</h3><ul><li><p>Affordable price structure for most</p></li><li><p>NetSuite is natively integrated</p></li><li><p>Can provide you with ERP and CRM modules all in one</p></li></ul><h3>Cons:</h3><ul><li><p>Limited customizability</p></li><li><p>Limited access to sales data</p></li><li><p>Not 100% responsive to SEO optimization techniques</p></li></ul><h2>Shopify</h2><p>Founded in 2004, Shopify is one of the oldest and most widely recognized eCommerce solutions currently on the web. It is known for its sleek, sophisticated themes sported by relevant brands, such as Tesla and Adidas. Shopify launched Shopify Plus early 2014 in order to attract large, enterprise-ready organizations like the aforementioned.
