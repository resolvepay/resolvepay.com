If you’ve ever had a personal credit card, you won’t find that a business card credit is any different in the sense of using it, but rather changes for what you use it.</p>\n<p>These cards are also used to build a business credit score and for incentives like travel points.

You will be required to show proof that your business exists, such as a statement of incorporation, business license, tax returns, financial statements, or similar documents.</p>\n<p>Sole proprietors can apply for a business credit card under their own name, since they operate under it.

There is a risk that business credit cards can be used irresponsibly by merchants or employees because of this.</p>\n<p>For example, a business may use a credit card, but not plan well enough in advance to be able to make payments on it. Similarly, poor management of business credit cards could result in excess spending on advertising or other areas of a company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Business credit cards help merchants gain access to instant cash flow, rewards, and a higher credit score, all without the need for any collateral. It seems like a dream come true, right?</p>\n<p>As good as it seems, there are some negatives to business credit cards to keep in mind. First, compared to a service like we offer at Resolve, you will be exposed to higher interest rates, extra charges, and hidden fees. These can add up over time.</p>\n<p>Second, a business credit card isn’t guaranteed to be secure. Credit card and identity theft is still a large issue in America, and growing in many ways. Merchants need to be aware of the risk they are carrying when using a credit card for business expenditures.</p>\n<p>Responsibility is another issue with credit cards, as the rush of having new cash flow can result in it being overused.</p>\n<p>This is why merchants should <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/contact-sales/\">contact us at Resolve</a> to learn more about how we can help you convert new leads, increase repeat purchases, and more through our payment solutions.</p>","headings":[{"depth":2,"id":"what-are-business-credit-cards","value":"What are business credit cards?"},{"depth":2,"id":"how-do-you-qualify-for-a-business-credit-card","value":"How do you qualify for a business credit card?"},{"depth":2,"id":"business-credit-card-advantages","value":"Business credit card advantages"},{"depth":3,"id":"access-to-easy-cash-flow","value":"Access to easy cash flow"},{"depth":3,"id":"rewards-and-incentives","value":"Rewards and incentives"},{"depth":3,"id":"builds-credit-score","value":"Builds credit score"},{"depth":3,"id":"no-collateral-is-required","value":"No collateral is required"},{"depth":2,"id":"business-credit-card-disadvantages","value":"Business credit card disadvantages"},{"depth":3,"id":"high-interest-rates-and-other-fees","value":"High interest rates and other fees"},{"depth":3,"id":"less-protection-than-other-forms-of-financing","value":"Less protection than other forms of financing"},{"depth":3,"id":"they-can-be-used-irresponsibly","value":"They can be used irresponsibly"},{"depth":2,"id":"conclusion","value":"Conclusion"}]}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://resolvepay.com"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"what-every-merchant-needs-to-know-about-business-credit-cards"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
