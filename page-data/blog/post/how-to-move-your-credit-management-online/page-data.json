We streamline your credit and Accounts Receivable tasks including credit checking, credit line decisioning, advancing net terms invoices, payment reminders, payment processing, and collections. This means we help manage every aspect of offering net terms to your customers.</p>\n<p>For every business customer you want to offer net terms to, we provide a ‘quiet’ credit check - only the business name and business address is needed. We’ll advise on the credit line and invoice advance rate they’re approved for with Resolve. On the AR side of things, we provide a payment portal under your business’ name that allows these customers to make payments online through the payment method of their choice. </p>\n<p>Resolve acts as your credit team enhancer. We make credit checking, credit decisions, and credit line management fast and simple. Everything you need is at your fingertips! And you’re able to set up every customer under this system, or just those you choose.</p>\n<p>One of the challenges of extending credit terms to customers is the lack of cash flow until you get paid. So, Resolve will pay up to 90% of each invoice for approved customers within one day of issuing the invoice.</p>\n<p>We give you the freedom to spend your time running your business, not stressing over credit management!</p>\n<h2 id=\"barriers-to-online-credit-management\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#barriers-to-online-credit-management\" aria-label=\"barriers to online credit management permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Barriers to online credit management</h2>\n<p>With all the advantages to moving your credit management online, you might wonder why some people are still using old systems.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, change—even good change—is hard to get on board with. Resolve understands this. We’ve made the system as easy as possible. We also empower you to choose whether to move all your clients to the online system, or only a few. And we’re here to support you every step of the way.</p>\n<p>Another concern is that online credit management will impact customer relations. By the numbers, we see a 20% increase in average order size when customers are approved for credit through Resolve, and a 90% faster sales cycle time. Customers love having access to net terms and being able to quickly and easily make payments online. Plus, everything they see is from your business, so there’s no interference in the credit and payment transactions.</p>\n<p>The Better Business Bureau receives many complaints about companies with sketchy collection practices, or, on the other side, those who rack up bad debts, hide behind bankruptcies, and consistently end up with their account numbers under collection accounts. Using online credit management, you can quickly rule out any company that's likely to turn into a debt recovery while highlighting the companies you want to extend credit to.</p>\n<p>You don't need to figure out nmls, ste, planos, or fdcpa to use credit management online. Just click and get started.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.contentful.com/x72jfbsnccq4/2Cc5Bab4h3n13Z05ySk9T5/f86e9e1aa35aa30b6c16666e681b81a3/AdobeStock_278867858.jpeg\" alt=\"businessman handshake after negotiations\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"time-for-less-paperwork\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#time-for-less-paperwork\" aria-label=\"time for less paperwork permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Time for less paperwork</h2>\n<p>One of the great things about online credit management is the big drop in physical paperwork! Your sales teams have access to credit applications right on their devices. They can often receive credit approval for a new customer during their visit, and they can confidently extend terms.</p>\n<p>End-of-month statements, invoices, and reminders all get shifted to the cloud where you can securely access them from anywhere—and you don’t need to keep walls of filing cabinets anymore.</p>\n<p>Would you like to see an update of your Accounts Receivable? Done. You have everything you need to keep track of your overall credit programs as well as individual accounts. And you can say goodbye to setting up manual reminders to track down payments. That’s all automated when you switch to online credit management.</p>\n<p>And, with effective credit checks that empower you to offer the right terms for each customer, you can stop acting like a collection agency, pursuing debt collections from customers who were given unreasonable lines of credit. No more phone calls to try to collect on late payments and bad debts. </p>\n<h2 id=\"tired-of-high-dso-days-sales-outstanding\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#tired-of-high-dso-days-sales-outstanding\" aria-label=\"tired of high dso days sales outstanding permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tired of high DSO (Days Sales Outstanding)?</h2>\n<p>Prompt and secure payment of up to 90% of approved customer’s invoices within one day means DSOs become a thing of the past. After all, wouldn’t you rather look at your daily sales numbers increasing than your DSOs?</p>\n<p>It's not uncommon for high DSOs to be a result of companies with poor credit reports, a history of past-due accounts, and even bankruptcies because companies didn't have the tools to check their customer's credit effectively. Resolve helps to establish the credit-worthiness of customers and saves you from needing a credit management lp, pursuing debt recovery, and facing low recovery rates on funds you desperately need. </p>\n<p>If a customer's business is too new to determine whether they are a good candidate for credit terms or even have a credit score, we'll let you know in real-time. And you'll still be able to offer them the option of paying immediately and easily with a credit card.</p>\n<p>You can stop acting like a bank, a debt collector, or a collection agency. Let Resolve partner with you to offer the right credit terms to your customers.</p>\n<p>With online credit management, your sales teams have the validation they need to close bigger sales, your accounts receivable and credit management are streamlined and current, and your consistent cash flow allows you to negotiate with suppliers, confidently expand, and know exactly where you stand financially.</p>","headings":[{"depth":2,"id":"online-credit-management-is-better","value":"Online credit management is better"},{"depth":2,"id":"how-resolve-makes-online-credit-management-easier","value":"How Resolve makes online credit management easier"},{"depth":2,"id":"barriers-to-online-credit-management","value":"Barriers to online credit management"},{"depth":2,"id":"time-for-less-paperwork","value":"Time for less paperwork"},{"depth":2,"id":"tired-of-high-dso-days-sales-outstanding","value":"Tired of high DSO (Days Sales Outstanding)?"}]}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://resolvepay.com"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"how-to-move-your-credit-management-online"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
