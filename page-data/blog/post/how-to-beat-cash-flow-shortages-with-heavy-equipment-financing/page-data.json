Keep reading to find out how you can lessen the financial blow by utilizing heavy equipment business financing.</p>\n<p>Heavy equipment is a term typically used in the construction industry to refer to the heavy machinery used.</p>\n<p>Therefore, heavy equipment financing means securing a business loan or lease to acquire, upgrade, or replace heavy-duty equipment and specialized machinery and vehicles. These may include construction equipment, such as bulldozers and dump trucks.</p>\n<p>It is different from equipment financing, which denotes funding for smaller items such as computers, desks, and file cabinets.</p>\n<p>If you sell heavy equipment, then you understand their prices can be colossal. It makes financial sense to sell the equipment to your customers through net terms. The ideal would be arranging heavy equipment leasing or financing options for them.</p>\n<p>Since heavy equipment is costly, heavy equipment financing allows even small businesses to purchase the right equipment without making upfront payments.</p>\n<p>You would use heavy machinery in timber, excavation, mining, and construction projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-heavy-equipment-financing-works\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-heavy-equipment-financing-works\" aria-label=\"how heavy equipment financing works permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How heavy equipment financing works</h2>\n<p>If a heavy equipment financing company decides you qualify for a heavy equipment loan, they will offer the following terms:</p>\n<p><strong>Funding amount:</strong> you may get funding up to 100% of the purchase price.

If you are not creditworthy or when buying used equipment, the finance company will require a down payment.</p>\n<p><strong>Interest rates:</strong> since it is not a risky loan, equipment financing loans feature interest rates as low as 5%. The usual range is between 8-30%, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Repayment terms:</strong> how long you pay the loan will depend on the projected lifespan of the equipment. In short, whether you go for the purchasing or leasing option, your repayment periods will not exceed the equipment’s useful life.</p>\n<p>Note that the size of the down payment, equipment condition, your credit score, and how long you have been in business will determine how favorable the financing terms will be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"types-of-equipment-finance-loans\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#types-of-equipment-finance-loans\" aria-label=\"types of equipment finance loans permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Types of equipment finance loans</h2>\n<h4 id=\"sba-loan\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sba-loan\" aria-label=\"sba loan permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>SBA loan</h4>\n<p>The Small Business Administration (SBA) loan is an excellent choice for established businesses with solid annual revenues and credit scores.

Resolve can solve this net terms cash flow crunch with their <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/net-terms-management/\">digital net terms solution.</a> Resolve will advance pay the net terms invoices of your approved customers. In fact, you will get the cash in the bank in 1 day, while your customers still get 30, 60, or even 90 days to pay. Maybe you’re thinking, ‘Hey this sounds like Factoring!’.

Whether you are looking for a road machine, industrial tool, or building construction equipment loan, there will be an equipment financing option for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Tax:</strong> according to the IRS Section 179 deduction guidelines, buying or leasing new equipment may entitle you to some tax relief. You may deduct 100% of the equipment purchase price from your taxable income even though you will pay for it over time.</p>\n<p>As you would expect, there are a few caveats. In 2021, the maximum deductible amount is $1,050,000. Further, you must also have a taxable profit in the year you bought the equipment for you to qualify for that tax relief.</p>\n<p>In short, if you bought equipment worth $500,000 and you had a taxable income of $25,000, you can only deduct $25,000.</p>\n<p>The great thing is Section 179 applies whether you bought new or used equipment.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> if you go the leasing route, that offers a ton of flexibility because you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sidestep the thorny issue of depreciation</li>\n<li>Retain liquidity since your cash is not tied to an asset</li>\n<li>No dealing with substantial maintenance costs</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Customization:</strong> most heavy equipment lenders offer customized financing structures. These are some of the factors they will consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business needs</li>\n<li>Monthly budget</li>\n<li>How many years the buyer has been in business</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Increased sales:</strong> if you required every buyer to purchase heavy equipment using cash, you would run out of business! That’s because very few can afford the sky-high pricing.</p>\n<p>It makes sound financial sense to accept monthly payments instead, and heavy equipment financing can help avoid a cash crunch when you do.</p>\n<p>To sum up, heavy equipment financing can help businesses acquire heavy machinery with prohibitive price tags. Conventional lenders require borrowers to have excellent credit scores.
