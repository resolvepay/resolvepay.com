Net terms are deferred payment terms. Often net terms provide a grace period before an invoice is due. Some companies may offer a discount for customers who choose to pay their bill before the due date. Net terms usually refer to a period of 30 or 60 calendar days before paying the amount due. </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-net-306090-terms-mean\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-do-net-306090-terms-mean\" aria-label=\"what do net 306090 terms mean permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What do net 30/60/90 terms mean?</h2>\n<p>Net 30/60/90 (also known as credit terms) is the number of days an invoice is due from its invoice date. Net 30 means the invoice is due in 30 days. Net 60 terms means the invoice is due in 60 days and so on. The start date can vary by company. Some companies may count the date that an invoice is postmarked (mail delivery) or sent (email). Those details will be made available to the customer so everyone agrees on the invoice terms.</p>\n<p>When to use net terms? Do you require the full amount to be paid as soon as possible? Unfortunately for some businesses net terms customer expectations are largely driven by its industry average. The net terms timing by industry vary across industries. Some may have net 45 terms while others have net 90. Staying around these averages allows a company to remain competitive on its net terms offering. Going with terms that are longer than the average means the company is unnecessarily providing free financing for customers. Terms that are too short means they are too aggressive.</p>\n<p>This is very different than offering credit card payments to your merchants. Unlike credit card payment, the purchasing company will typically not incur any late payment fees as long as their account is paid off within the net terms agreement they have signed. A credit card will typically start charging interest after 1 month, whereas some net terms can last 60 or 90 days and beyond.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-digital-net-terms-platforms\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-are-digital-net-terms-platforms\" aria-label=\"what are digital net terms platforms permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What are digital net terms platforms?</h2>\n<p>Want to automate and de-risk your net terms program? As a supplier, managing the credit checking process costs your AR team a lot of time. They have to get the customer to fill in the credit application, call the trade references, make a credit limit decision. Even then, it's not risk-free. Floating net terms credit ties up cash flow and there's still a risk.

When payments aren’t due immediately, barriers to purchasing go down. These small businesses are generally more willing to buy on credit. For some customers, they may depend on credit for all of their purchases. Offering net terms ropes in some of these customers. It's important to outline your specific invoice payment terms on all invoices. If you are offering longer payment terms, specify the invoice amount, the payment due date, and payment options. Note that net terms are usually offered interest-free. </p>\n<h5 id=\"gain-an-advantage-over-competitors\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#gain-an-advantage-over-competitors\" aria-label=\"gain an advantage over competitors permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Gain an advantage over competitors</h5>\n<p>As a stable larger business, your business will have an advantage over competitors who don’t offer net terms. If it is common for some industries to offer net terms, not offering them puts a company at a disadvantage. New clients will gravitate toward the path of least resistance for purchasing anything. This means purchasing on credit even if there's the possibility of incurring late fees. </p>\n<p>Companies like <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/customers/hyperikon/\">Hyperikon</a> that offer net terms over those that don’t will likely see more customers come their way. Who wouldn't like an extra 30 business days to pay.</p>\n<h5 id=\"build-customer-loyalty\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#build-customer-loyalty\" aria-label=\"build customer loyalty permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Build customer loyalty</h5>\n<p>Giving customers some leeway will help build customer loyalty. Net terms can be a door to new customers. New customers come in for free financing but if the company can provide good customer service, quality products, and competitive pricing on top of net terms, it can build strong loyalty with customers. </p>\n<p>Net terms alone may provide some customer loyalty but if competitors are offering the same terms, a company will need to provide an edge (as mentioned above) to keep customers loyal.</p>\n<p>Coupling net terms with an incentive for early payment may be just that edge that you could leverage to keep your customers loyal. Early payment plans are not only a great way to gain customer loyalty, it also provides an opportunity for you to receive full payment of your accounts receivables sooner. </p>\n<h2 id=\"disadvantages-of-offering-net-306090-terms\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#disadvantages-of-offering-net-306090-terms\" aria-label=\"disadvantages of offering net 306090 terms permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Disadvantages of offering net 30/60/90 terms</h2>\n<p>While there are many positives to offering net terms, there are a few things to be aware of. Your billing cycle will become longer, some customers will not pay at all, and there is more overhead. It can also add complexity to your accounting software (quickbooks) or invoicing software. Small business owners may not want to take on the financial risk either. But for many businesses, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.</p>\n<h5 id=\"customers-take-longer-to-pay\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#customers-take-longer-to-pay\" aria-label=\"customers take longer to pay permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Customers take longer to pay</h5>\n<p>Repayment will take longer if you offer net terms and may affect your profit margin. The payment cycle will extend, and your operations will need to change to accommodate a more extended payment cycle with a 30 or 60 day period. Deferring when your client pays will affect your working capital, as well. At first, working capital may significantly decrease, but once the payment cycle becomes routine, working capital should go back to previous levels. Be clear about any percent discount and outline when the invoice is payable. </p>\n<p>New terms may need to be negotiated with suppliers since working capital may not initially be available. As your payment terms get extended due to offering net terms, supplier terms, in turn, may need to extend as well. Otherwise, the company may experience a cash flow crunch in which money is not available to meet immediate expenses. </p>\n<h5 id=\"some-customers-may-not-pay-at-all\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#some-customers-may-not-pay-at-all\" aria-label=\"some customers may not pay at all permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Some customers may not pay at all</h5>\n<p>Even while offering an early payment discount, some customers will likely end up not paying at all. It might sound a bit extreme, but nonpayment on net terms is common. However, nonpayments should be a very small percentage of invoiced customers. If there are a lot of nonpayments, this is a sign that credit screening is poor. Customers that should not be paying on credit (because they do not qualify) are being allowed into the company’s credit program.</p>\n<p>Nonpaying customers don’t mean it's the end of the line in regards to collecting your money. You can continue to send notices to these customers and eventually start reducing the amount they owe. Some of these customers may pay all or some of the reduced amount. At some point, you might consider hiring a collection agency.

It is a great way to attract new customers and can help a business grow. Implementing net terms will create a longer billing cycle since customers will no longer pay immediately. Understanding this longer billing cycle and preparing for it, such as using suppliers that offer net terms, will help maintain working capital and avoid a cash flow crunch. <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/net-terms/\">Resolve's Net Terms</a> can help you take care of all the details of offering net terms to your customers.</p>","headings":[{"depth":2,"id":"what-are-net-terms","value":"What are net terms?"},{"depth":2,"id":"what-do-net-306090-terms-mean","value":"What do net 30/60/90 terms mean?"},{"depth":2,"id":"what-are-digital-net-terms-platforms","value":"What are digital net terms platforms?"},{"depth":2,"id":"advantages-of-offering-net-306090-terms-or-credit-terms","value":"Advantages of offering net 30/60/90 terms or credit terms"},{"depth":5,"id":"generate-more-sales","value":"Generate more sales"},{"depth":5,"id":"gain-an-advantage-over-competitors","value":"Gain an advantage over competitors"},{"depth":5,"id":"build-customer-loyalty","value":"Build customer loyalty"},{"depth":2,"id":"disadvantages-of-offering-net-306090-terms","value":"Disadvantages of offering net 30/60/90 terms"},{"depth":5,"id":"customers-take-longer-to-pay","value":"Customers take longer to pay"},{"depth":5,"id":"some-customers-may-not-pay-at-all","value":"Some customers may not pay at all"},{"depth":5,"id":"poorer-cash-flow","value":"Poorer cash flow"},{"depth":5,"id":"more-administrative-duties","value":"More administrative duties"},{"depth":2,"id":"who-offers-net-terms","value":"Who offers net terms?"},{"depth":5,"id":"invoice-based-businesses","value":"Invoice-based businesses"},{"depth":5,"id":"b2b-businesses","value":"B2B businesses"},{"depth":5,"id":"suppliers","value":"Suppliers"},{"depth":2,"id":"conclusion","value":"Conclusion"}]}}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://resolvepay.com"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"net-terms"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
