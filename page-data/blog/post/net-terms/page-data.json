You'll have to conduct <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/blog/post/understanding-how-trade-references-work/\">trade reference checks</a>, keep track of sent invoices, net terms for each customer, discounts, nonpayment, and collections. Much of your AR can be outsourced, which removes virtually all (AR) complexity out of the company and allows you to focus on your core competencies.</p>\n<p>Even things a simple as keeping track if you were offering net 30 or 60 or 90 day terms makes things so much more complex as you suddenly now have to keep track of these distinct customized terms with each of your clients adds a lot of administrative time to your workflow. You will also need to keep track of invoicing all of your different customers on different cadences depending on when they signed their net terms agreement with you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-offers-net-terms\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#who-offers-net-terms\" aria-label=\"who offers net terms permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Who offers net terms?</h2>\n<p>It depends on the industry. If most companies within an industry offer net terms, then any new entrants will likely have to do the same to remain competitive. Of course, nothing keeps any business from offering net terms.</p>\n<p><strong>Invoice-based businesses</strong></p>\n<p>Any business that bills by invoice rather than upfront may offer net terms. As previously mentioned, if it is standard in your industry to offer net terms, you basically have no choice but to offer them. If net terms are not standard in your industry, offering them is generally a plus and can help your business grow.</p>\n<p><strong>B2B businesses</strong></p>\n<p>B2B businesses commonly offer net terms to smaller business clients. Most businesses deal on net terms. For B2B businesses, it is common to offer net terms.</p>\n<p><strong>Suppliers</strong></p>\n<p>Food and materials suppliers commonly like <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/customers/sdi-fire/\">SDi Fire (see our case study)</a> offer net terms. Just as you might offer net terms to your customers, suppliers and vendors also offer them for the same reasons — to attract and keep customers. If you are just starting to implement net terms, which will create a longer payment cycle, using suppliers who also offer net terms can help to offset your payment cycle and avoid a cash flow crunch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Net terms provide a grace period from the invoice date for customers to pay. It is a great way to attract new customers and can help a business grow. Implementing net terms will create a longer billing cycle since customers will no longer pay immediately. Understanding this longer billing cycle and preparing for it, such as using suppliers that offer net terms, will help maintain working capital and avoid a cash flow crunch. <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/net-terms/\">Resolve's Net Terms</a> can help you take care of all the details of offering net terms to your customers.</p>","headings":[{"depth":2,"id":"what-are-net-terms","value":"What are net terms?"},{"depth":2,"id":"advantages-of-offering-net-306090-terms-or-credit-terms","value":"Advantages of offering net 30/60/90 terms or credit terms"},{"depth":2,"id":"disadvantages-of-offering-net-306090-terms","value":"Disadvantages of offering net 30/60/90 terms"},{"depth":2,"id":"who-offers-net-terms","value":"Who offers net terms?"},{"depth":2,"id":"conclusion","value":"Conclusion"}]}},"summary":"Want to learn what net terms are?
