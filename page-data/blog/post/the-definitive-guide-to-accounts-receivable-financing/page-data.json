In layman’s terms, A/R financing is a service that helps business owners improve their cash flow.</p>\n<p>As a result, they are able to grow faster and not experience as many interruptions. Lenders provide an advance against unpaid invoices, ensuring a business has sufficient funds to operate and grow its business while waiting to be paid by customers.</p>\n<p>Customers will receive a line of credit that is based on the unpaid invoices currently owed in <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/blog/post/net-terms/\">30, 60, and 90-day periods</a>, and the process is typically simple. You would create an account with an A/R company, and go through an application process to determine your options.</p>\n<p>Several factors are analyzed to determine if you qualify for this type of financing, including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your credit history</li>\n<li>The accounting history of your company</li>\n<li>Business revenue</li>\n<li>Whether your invoices are late or not</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Compared to factoring, accounts receivable financing tends to be more flexible, too. You choose the exact invoices for which you wish to receive an advance, and it doesn’t require large monthly minimums.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-are-the-best-candidates-for-ar-financing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#who-are-the-best-candidates-for-ar-financing\" aria-label=\"who are the best candidates for ar financing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Who are the best candidates for A/R financing?</h2>\n<p>This type of financing is ideal for small-to-medium-sized businesses that are interested in enhancing cash flow.

Instead of waiting 30, 60, or 90 days to receive an invoice, you can get an advance for a similar amount. This money can be used to pay employees, cover expenses, or for marketing.</p>\n<p>Invoicing can also be a stressful and time consuming process, which A/R financing easily fixes. You get your cash up front, giving you peace of mind to continue operating your company. No personal collateral needs to be put up, either.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it still has several drawbacks. First, merchants will still need to be responsible for billing, collections, and underwriting -- all of which are time consuming and difficult. The advance is often not the full amount of the invoice being financed, either.</p>\n<p>Traditional lenders also don’t help with sales or marketing, which Resolve <em>does</em>.
