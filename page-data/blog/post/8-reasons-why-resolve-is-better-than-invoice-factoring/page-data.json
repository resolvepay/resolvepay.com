Resolve Pay unlocks cash flow faster</h2>\n<p>Speeding up cash flow and having more working capital upfront can transform the financial health of your business and have a huge impact on growth. That’s why Resolve Pay gets you cash faster. In fact, approved invoices are advance paid within one day. Our same day funding makes us one of the fastesr financing options available.</p>\n<p>We perform a one-time credit check on your customers before extending them a line of credit. Once a customer is approved, Resolve Pay will advance pay up to 90% upfront on the value of each invoice until the customer’s credit limit is reached. So when that customer buys from you again, you’re not forced to wait for approval before you receive another advance.</p>\n<p>Factoring services, on the other hand, require you to go through an invoice-by-invoice application process. Which means you’re forced to wait for a decision every time you want to know your approved advance rate, unlock upfront cash from from a net terms invoice, and receive your cash advance.</p>\n<p>If you want to access your cash flow faster and use it to grow your business, Resolve Pay is the better choice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-resolve-pay-assumes-the-risk-of-non-payment\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#2-resolve-pay-assumes-the-risk-of-non-payment\" aria-label=\"2 resolve pay assumes the risk of non payment permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. Resolve Pay assumes the risk of non-payment</h2>\n<p>If you want to extend net terms to customers without the risk, choose Resolve Pay.</p>\n<p>Our financing is non-recourse, which means that we (Resolve Pay) are on the hook if a customer doesn’t pay or goes bust. Factoring works differently. With an invoice factoring service, your business is responsible for covering any outstanding customer debt.</p>\n<p>We’ll take on the risk of non-payment, advance your business up to 90% of approved customer invoices within 1 day, and give your customers 30, 60, or 90 days to pay us—all for a fee that’s cheaper than credit card processing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I've been regularly seeing much larger orders with Resolve Pay than I would have otherwise seen without net terms as a payment option for invoices, a huge win for our wholesale business.\"</p>\n<p>— Ray Gil, Account Executive, Hyperikon</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"3-factoring-fees-are-high\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#3-factoring-fees-are-high\" aria-label=\"3 factoring fees are high permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. Factoring fees are high</h2>\n<p>The average factoring fee is surprisingly high. Depending on the type of invoice factoring you use (e.g. recourse factoring, non-recourse factoring, accounts receivable factoring, full factoring), a factor will typically take 20-40% of the invoice amount. So if low rates are a priority, invoice factoring isn't a great choice. </p>\n<p><strong>Here’s what the fees would look like for a $1000 invoice with 30-day net terms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolve Pay’s fee (2.61%) = $26.10</li>\n<li>Factoring company fee (20%) = $200</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike factoring companies, Resolve Pay also gives you the option to choose how much you’re advanced on each invoice, which can further reduce your fees over time.</p>\n<p>To see how this works, let’s use the same scenario. Say you have a $1,000 invoice but you only really want 50% of that invoice to be advanced to your business.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolve Pay would only charge fees on the advanced amount ($500 x 2.61%) = $13.05</li>\n<li>A factoring company would still charge fees on the total invoice ($1000 x 20%) = $200</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One final thing to keep in mind with factoring fees is that these numbers compound at the enterprise level. Imagine how much of the total invoice amount you'd miss out on if you factored a $250,000 invoice with a factoring service.</p>\n<p>When you do the math, choosing Resolve Pay is a no-brainer.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x72jfbsnccq4/3PuENmHOUPm5DQuOpXcP4p/afdc2acadeadeb17f210ca26123f75a0/Resolve_vs_Factoring_3.png\" alt=\"iPhone \"></p>\n<h2 id=\"4-invoice-factoring-company-fee-structures-are-not-transparent\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#4-invoice-factoring-company-fee-structures-are-not-transparent\" aria-label=\"4 invoice factoring company fee structures are not transparent permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>4. Invoice factoring company fee structures are not transparent</h2>\n<p>With Resolve Pay, you never have to worry about hidden fees or surprise charges. Our <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/pricing/\">fee structure</a> is intentionally simple and transparent (we charge a flat-fee of 2.61% for 30-day net terms invoices with a 90% advance). And pricing is always available on <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/pricing/\">our website</a>.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, factoring costs are hard to make sense of. Factoring company fee structures are typically complex. Advance rates are hugely varied. And factoring rates often include hidden fees and surprise additional fees. Some invoice factoring companies may include things like servicing fees,  termination fees, money transfer fees, renewal fees, or even monthly minimums.</p>\n<p>So even if it looks like an invoice factoring service could offer you a good deal before you sign up, it’s not always easy to calculate the total factoring costs you'll end up paying to a factoring company over time.</p>\n<p>It's also important to remember that you’re dealing with a buyers market when you work with a factor. Expensive factoring rates also take advantage of the fact that invoice factoring is a one-off type transaction that companies only really use when they're having cash flow problems or in a bit of hot water. Resolve Pay doesn’t operate like that. We’re interested in ongoing relationships with our customers. So we offer lower rates and a sustainable and value-added solution that integrates seamlessly with your accounts receivable processes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-factoring-can-damage-your-b2b-relationships\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#5-factoring-can-damage-your-b2b-relationships\" aria-label=\"5 factoring can damage your b2b relationships permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>5. Factoring can damage your B2B relationships</h2>\n<p>When it’s time to collect a late payment on an unpaid invoice or an outstanding invoice, a factoring company will bombard your customers with automated email reminders until they pay. And if that doesn’t work, invoice factoring services often engage debt-collection-agency scare tactics to make your cough up.</p>\n<p>It doesn't matter if you're running a small business, a startup, or a large enterprise. Any business owner will know how damaging these approaches can be to long-standing customer relationships.</p>\n<p>Just like a factoring company, Resolve Pay will help your business collect late payments—it’s built into our <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/pricing/\">pricing</a>. But we prioritize gold-standard support for you and your customers. So when it’s time to follow up on an unpaid invoice, a late payment, or outstanding invoice, we don’t act like a collections agency. Our team works with you to figure out the best approach for your company and your customer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Resolve Pay allows our customers to purchase high volume and/or high quantity orders while utilizing credit terms.

Factoring is a huge red flag to your customers</h2>\n<p>There’s a stigma attached to invoice factoring. And it can rub off on your company, whether you're running a small business, a startup, or a large enterprise.</p>\n<p>When a business turns to invoice factoring, it tells customers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My supplier has a cash-flow problem</li>\n<li>My supplier isn’t doing as well as I thought they were</li>\n<li>My supplier might be going out of business soon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understandably, these are all red flags to your buyers. Business customers need to know that their supply chain is strong. If invoice factoring gives the impression that your company is “weaker,” or that it might be going out of business soon, customers are more likely to work with your competitors to reduce risk.</p>\n<p>Resolve Pay brings none of these negative red flags with your customers, because Resolve Pay is a white-labelled experience that acts like your ‘credit team on tap’. Beyond financing, we take care of business credit checks, credit line decisioning, net terms invoicing, payment processing, and reminders.  </p>\n<p>From your customer's perspective, Resolve Pay is an improved payments portal where they can easily pay invoices to you. In fact, Resolve Pay gives your customers more ways to pay by accepting ACH, check, or transfer as payment methods.</p>\n<p>And on the business side, your team benefits from an integrated accounts receivable platform that helps you manage every aspect of net terms like any Fortune 500 company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-resolve-pay-helps-you-increase-b2b-sales\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#7-resolve-pay-helps-you-increase-b2b-sales\" aria-label=\"7 resolve pay helps you increase b2b sales permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>7. Resolve Pay helps you increase B2B sales</h2>\n<p>Resolve Pay performs smart customer credit assessments in hours. And we share your customer’s credit results with you. With this information on hand, it's easier to understand each customer's creditworthiness and decide which customers to offer net terms to. But you can also use this data to drive sales and increase order sizes.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say one of your small business customers buys $10,000 worth of goods and Resolve Pay approves the customer for a total credit line of $100,000.</p>\n<p>Next time that customer places an order, you don't need to worry about their creditworthiness because you can see their credit results and you know that they’re approved for an additional $90,000 in credit. So you can safely pitch a larger order size, knowing that you can extend net terms to the customer with Resolve Pay and get advanced up to 90% of the invoice value of that net terms invoice upfront.</p>\n<p>Even the best factoring companies don’t share customer credit lines, credit results or credit scores, so you’re always left in the dark.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x72jfbsnccq4/SK9xF0YbCpDzSMfa33qZg/c310a148540fd021c5530414a4ba2642/Resolve_vs_Factoring_1.png\" alt=\"Counting money\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"8-resolve-is-your-credit-team-on-tap\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#8-resolve-is-your-credit-team-on-tap\" aria-label=\"8 resolve is your credit team on tap permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>8.
