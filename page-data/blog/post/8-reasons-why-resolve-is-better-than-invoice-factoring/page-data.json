Resolve Pay unlocks cash flow faster</h2>\n<p>Speeding up cash flow can transform the financial health of your business and have a huge impact on growth. That’s why Resolve Pay gets you cash faster. In fact, approved invoices are advance paid within one day. </p>\n<p>We perform a one-time credit check on your customers before extending them a line of credit. Once a customer is approved, Resolve Pay will advance pay up to 90% on each invoice until the customer’s credit limit is reached. So when that customer buys from you again, you’re not forced to wait for approval before you receive another advance.</p>\n<p>Factoring companies, on the other hand, require you to seek approval on an invoice-by-invoice basis. Which means you’re forced to wait for a decision every time you want to unlock cash from a net terms invoice and receive a cash advance.</p>\n<p>If you want to access your cash flow faster and use it to grow your business, Resolve Pay is the better choice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-resolve-pay-assumes-the-risk-of-non-payment\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#2-resolve-pay-assumes-the-risk-of-non-payment\" aria-label=\"2 resolve pay assumes the risk of non payment permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. Resolve Pay assumes the risk of non-payment</h2>\n<p>If you want to extend net terms to customers without the risk, choose Resolve Pay.</p>\n<p>Our financing is non-recourse, which means that we (Resolve Pay) are on the hook if a customer doesn’t pay or goes bust. With factoring companies, your business is responsible for covering any outstanding customer debt.</p>\n<p>We’ll take on the risk of non-payment, advance your business up to 90% of approved customer invoices within 1 day, and give your customers 30, 60, or 90 days to pay us—all for a fee that’s cheaper than credit card processing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I've been regularly seeing much larger orders with Resolve than I would have otherwise seen without net terms as a payment option for invoices, a huge win for our wholesale business.\"</p>\n<p>— Ray Gil, Account Executive, Hyperikon</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"3-factoring-company-fees-are-high\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#3-factoring-company-fees-are-high\" aria-label=\"3 factoring company fees are high permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. Factoring company fees are high</h2>\n<p>It’s no secret that factoring company fees are high. Depending on the type of invoice factoring you use, a factor will typically take 20-40% of an invoice.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s what the fees would look like for a $1000 invoice with 30-day net terms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolve’s fee (2.61%) = $26.10</li>\n<li>Factoring company’s fee (20%) = $200</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike factoring companies, Resolve Pay also gives you the option to choose how much you’re advanced on each invoice, which can further reduce your fees over time.</p>\n<p>To see how this works, let’s use the same scenario. Say you have a $1,000 invoice but you only really want 50% of that invoice to be advanced to your business.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolve Pay would only charge fees on the advanced amount ($500 x 2.61%) = $13.05</li>\n<li>A factoring company would still charge fees on the total invoice ($1000 x 20%) = $200</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind, these numbers compound at the enterprise level. Imagine how much revenue you’d be missing out on if you factored a $250,000 invoice.</p>\n<p>When you do the math, choosing Resolve Pay is a no-brainer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-factoring-fees-are-not-transparent\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#4-factoring-fees-are-not-transparent\" aria-label=\"4 factoring fees are not transparent permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>4. Factoring fees are not transparent</h2>\n<p>With Resolve Pay, you never have to worry about hidden fees or surprise charges. Our <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/pricing/\">fee structure</a> is intentionally simple and transparent (we charge a flat-fee of 2.61% for 30-day net terms invoices with a 90% advance). And pricing is always available on <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/pricing/\">our website</a>.</p>\n<p>On the flipside, factoring company fee structures are complex and often include hidden fees. So it’s not always clear how much it’s truly costing you to factor each invoice. </p>\n<p>It's also important to remember that you’re dealing with a buyers market when you work with a factor. Factoring companies can also take advantage of the fact that it’s a one-off type transaction and you go to them when you really need them. Resolve Pay doesn’t operate like that. We’re interested in ongoing relationships with our customers. So we offer a sustainable and value-added solution that integrates seamlessly with your Accounts Receivable processes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-factoring-can-damage-your-b2b-relationships\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#5-factoring-can-damage-your-b2b-relationships\" aria-label=\"5 factoring can damage your b2b relationships permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>5. Factoring can damage your B2B relationships</h2>\n<p>When it’s time to collect a late payment, factoring companies will bombard your customers with automated email reminders until they pay. And if that doesn’t work, they’ll use debt-collection-agency scare tactics until your customers cough up.</p>\n<p>Both of these approaches are bad news for long-standing customer relationships.</p>\n<p>Just like a factoring company, Resolve Pay will help your business collect late payments—it’s built into our <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/pricing/\">pricing</a>. But we prioritize gold-standard support for you and your customers. So when it’s time to follow up on an outstanding payment, we don’t act like a collections agency. Our team works with you to figure out the best approach for your company and your customer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Resolve Pay allows our customers to purchase high volume and/or high quantity orders while utilizing credit terms.

Factoring is a huge red flag to your customers</h2>\n<p>There’s a stigma attached to invoice factoring. And it can rub off on your business.</p>\n<p>When a company turns to invoice factoring, it tells customers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My supplier has a cash-flow problem</li>\n<li>My supplier isn’t doing as well as I thought they were</li>\n<li>My supplier might be going out of business soon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understandably, these are all red flags to your buyers. Business customers need to know that their supply chain is strong. If invoice factoring gives the impression that your business is “weaker,” or that it might be going out of business soon, customers are more likely to work with your competitors to reduce risk.</p>\n<p>Resolve Pay brings none of these negative red flags with your customers, because Resolve Pay is a white-labelled experience that acts like your ‘credit team on tap’. Beyond financing, we take care of business credit checks, credit line decisioning, net terms invoicing, payment processing, and reminders.  </p>\n<p>From your customer's perspective, Resolve Pay is an improved payments portal where they can easily pay invoices to you. In fact, Resolve Pay gives your customers more ways to pay by accepting ACH, check, or transfer as payment methods.</p>\n<p>And on the business side, your team benefits from an integrated accounts receivable platform that helps you manage every aspect of net terms like any Fortune 500 company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-resolve-pay-helps-you-increase-b2b-sales\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#7-resolve-pay-helps-you-increase-b2b-sales\" aria-label=\"7 resolve pay helps you increase b2b sales permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>7. Resolve Pay helps you increase B2B sales</h2>\n<p>Resolve Pay performs smart customer credit assessments in hours. And we share your customer’s credit results with you. With this information on hand, it’s easier to decide which customers to offer net terms to. But you can also use this data to drive sales and increase order sizes.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say your customer buys $10,000 worth of goods and Resolve Pay approves the customer for a total credit line of $100,000.</p>\n<p>Next time that customer places an order, you’ll know that they’re approved for an additional $90,000 in credit. So you can safely pitch a larger order size, knowing that you can extend net terms to the customer with Resolve Pay.</p>\n<p>Factoring companies don’t share customer credit results, so you’re always left in the dark.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-resolve-is-your-credit-team-on-tap\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#8-resolve-is-your-credit-team-on-tap\" aria-label=\"8 resolve is your credit team on tap permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>8.
