Can you afford any payment delinquency?</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-diy-credit-checks-dont-scale-well\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#2-diy-credit-checks-dont-scale-well\" aria-label=\"2 diy credit checks dont scale well permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. DIY credit checks don't scale well</h2>\n<p>More customers mean more business, which is great for your bottom line. But more customers also means running more business credit reports, which ultimately results in more work for your team.</p>\n<p>Sure, your accounting or Accounts Receivable (AR) team might be able to perform business credit checks at the moment. But would they still be able to handle the workload if your customer base doubled or tripled?</p>\n<p>As things ramp up, it's common for the following issues to arise: It's tempting to make quick, risky credit decisions just to close a sale.</p>\n<p>Small businesses are even hard to check properly as they don't show up on credit monitoring services or business credit bureaus. Unfortunately for sole proprietors, a personal credit score and putting forward personal finance info like a social security number just doesn't cut it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sales reps override set credit limits, which can expose you to levels of bad debt that your company may not be able to handle</li>\n<li>It's harder to follow up with customers in a timely manner</li>\n<li>Overdue payments can slip through the cracks</li>\n<li>Mistakes and inaccuracies on bills, invoices, or credit terms are easy to overlook</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to Lockstep Collect, most <a href=\"https://anytimecollect.com/blog/how-your-invoice-volume-is-impacting-your-accounts-receivable-management/\">companies should staff at least one full-time credit professional for every 1,000 invoices created each month</a>, along with a backup resource and a supervisor.</p>\n<p>Unless you plan to bring on new employees to focus exclusively on business credit checks as your customer base grows, the DIY method is not a scalable approach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-if-a-credit-check-takes-too-long-sales-will-suffer\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#3-if-a-credit-check-takes-too-long-sales-will-suffer\" aria-label=\"3 if a credit check takes too long sales will suffer permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. If a credit check takes too long, sales will suffer</h2>\n<p>Best case scenario: your team can confidently approve a customer's credit in a matter of days. But not every business credit report is created equally. If calling references and running other background checks takes longer than expected, it could take weeks to extend net terms to a customer.</p>\n<p>Even though you're probably offering business credit to drive sales, a lengthy credit check process can scare customers away. Especially if your competitors are offering <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/\">instant business credit approval</a> and <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/net-terms/\">favorable net terms</a>. Not every customer will have business credit cards (likely with high interest rates) on hand with a high limit. Especially small business owners may be struggling, looking for a business loan and that can affect creditworthiness too.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x72jfbsnccq4/4gygB4W2jrtr9RhZv4dmjK/6741fd91f79f67b0ee41883cefd6e10e/0f77e0a5-6286-4fc7-b715-b7ecf4813ab9.jpeg\" alt=\"0f77e0a5-6286-4fc7-b715-b7ecf4813ab9\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"4-credit-bureau-reports-like-experian-are-expensive-and-dont-eliminate-risk\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#4-credit-bureau-reports-like-experian-are-expensive-and-dont-eliminate-risk\" aria-label=\"4 credit bureau reports like experian are expensive and dont eliminate risk permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>4. Credit bureau reports like Experian are expensive and don't eliminate risk</h2>\n<p>On average, major credit bureaus like 'experian business credit score' checks charge between $40-$140 USD for a business credit report. These reports can show you things like a business's credit score, repayment history, bankruptcies, tax liens, previous lawsuits, and risk of failure. But even with all of that information on hand, it's still up to you to decide how to act on that information.</p>\n<p>What factors will you use to approve a customer's credit application? Apart from their business credit report? The business's experience, their policies, their sba or sales data? Maybe the person you're dealing with just gives you a good vibe?</p>\n<p>And when you do decide to approve a request for business credit, how much credit will you actually extend and what net terms will you provide? 30, 60, or 90 days? </p>\n<p>This is where a B2B net terms management solution like <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/\">Resolve</a> has the upper hand. We process tens of thousands of credit applications a year, which gives us the data and the experience required to benchmark a customer's credit profile against thousands of others, spot trends, and eliminate unnecessary risk.</p>\n<p>Even if you are using experian, unless you plan to review thousands of llc's credit applications every year, there's no way your interpretation skills of business credit score or your internal processes will be sharp enough to spot every red flag before it's too late.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-credit-scores-you-can-never-be-sure-youre-making-the-right-decision\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#5-credit-scores-you-can-never-be-sure-youre-making-the-right-decision\" aria-label=\"5 credit scores you can never be sure youre making the right decision permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>5. Credit scores: You can never be sure you're making the right decision</h2>\n<p>Ok, you did the one-time Dun &#x26; Bradstreet, Equifax, Intelliscore or Fico check. But just because a customer checks out on paper—a healthy public record, credit score, no outstanding liens, glowing references—there's no way to guarantee that you're making a \"good\" decision when you approve their credit request. Major business credit bureau reports are only half the story.</p>\n<p>A business that's doing well now could default on their credit in the future for any number of reasons. Take the pandemic as an example. Entire industries were wiped out during the first wave of unexpected lockdowns. Overnight, thousands of businesses had no ability to repay outstanding invoices.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, your business is acting like a lender when it extends credit to other business owners. You might think you're making a sound decision based on the old-school credit check process. But if the business relationships or customers' circumstances change, your company could find itself on the hook for sudden, excessive debt that will never be repaid.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-youre-exposing-your-company-to-b2b-fraud\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#6-youre-exposing-your-company-to-b2b-fraud\" aria-label=\"6 youre exposing your company to b2b fraud permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>6.

Late payments can jeopardize your cash flow</h2>\n<p>When customers fall behind on their payments, cash flow suffers. Maybe your company could probably handle a few late payments here and there. But if enough customers defaulted on their payments to cause serious cash flow issues, your business could find itself in a sea of trouble.</p>\n<p>For argument's sake, let's say the worst comes to pass. Here’s a look at the cash flow woes that could impact your organization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your team would shoulder an additional administrative burden, just to stay on top of delayed payments </li>\n<li>Your company could be forced to default on payments to vendors</li>\n<li>Vendors might charge overdue fees for late or partial payments</li>\n<li>Your business credit rating could take a hit</li>\n<li>Lack of funds would reduce your company's ability to keep trading, advertising, and scaling</li>\n<li>You may need to seek a loan or additional funding to cover the debt</li>\n<li>Worst case scenario: you'll run out of cash entirely</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It sounds so extreme that you might think it could never happen to you. But according to <a href=\"https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/net-terms\">Freshbooks' analysis of over 20 million invoices</a>, 64% of small businesses have to wait for late invoice payments and 60% of small businesses suffer from cash flow optimization challenges every single month.</p>\n<p>Before you decide to perform business credit checks and extend net terms to customers, ask yourself if it's really worth the risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-collecting-debt-will-cost-your-business-time-and-money\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#8-collecting-debt-will-cost-your-business-time-and-money\" aria-label=\"8 collecting debt will cost your business time and money permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>8.
