ACH is another way to increase your payment method offerings, allowing you to reach a broader audience of customers. Some customers will simply prefer to pay via ACH than any other method. Not everyone accepts ACH as payment, so you’ll already be ahead of those competitors.</p>\n<p>Similar to credit cards, ACH payments can be disputed. When that happens, you’ll incur a fee. The key to avoiding ACH disputes is in understanding ACH Dispute Codes. The more you know about these codes, the better your chances will be in avoiding them.</p>\n<p>In this article, we look at ACH dispute codes, grouped by similarity, to get a better understanding of what’s happening behind each code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-ach-dispute-codes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-are-ach-dispute-codes\" aria-label=\"what are ach dispute codes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What Are ACH Dispute Codes?</h2>\n<p>An ACH dispute code is created when a payment is returned to the customer because the customer disputed the payment, there were issues with the financial institution processing the payment, unauthorized use, insufficient funds, and/or a number of other reasons. Customers have up to 90 days to dispute a payment.</p>\n<p>An ACH dispute results in a chargeback for the business that processed the payment. Chargeback fees can start at $25 and go up from there. You can attempt to work with the customer on a resolution and potentially have the chargeback reversed. Use the code received for the dispute to look it up below. This will help you to narrow a resolution.</p>\n<p>ACH payments are run through the ACH network, which is overseen by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (NACHA). <a href=\"https://www.nacha.org/\">NACHA</a> has certain return levels that its customers must stay below to avoid having their account closed. The level for <a href=\"https://www.nacha.org/rules/ach-network-risk-and-enforcement-topics\">Unauthorized Debit Entries is 0.5 percent</a>. This is down from 1.0 percent. NACHA believes that rates of return over 0.5 percent indicate problematic origination practices.</p>\n<p>The following is a list of ACH dispute codes, grouped by category.</p>\n<h2 id=\"administrative-failures\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#administrative-failures\" aria-label=\"administrative failures permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Administrative Failures</h2>\n<p>Administrative failure codes can be related to customers not typing in the right account number.

When he/she sees a charge from “SC Plaz” instead of Scottsdale Auto Plaza, he/she may dispute it.</p>\n<p>If the name of your business is truncated or otherwise looks different on customer statements, inform the customer of how the business name will appear on the statement. You can do this verbally (best) and by printing this info on the receipt. Even if you inform the customer verbally, always include the info again on the receipt.</p>\n<p>As well, include your customer service phone number on the receipt. Also, be sure the voicemail states the business name.

Sometimes the issue may simply be a matter of the customer not recognizing the charge.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the customer may not know why the charge was disputed. For those disputes, check the two sections above titled “Common ACH Return Codes” and “Unauthorized Debit Entries.” You and the customer may need to contact the customer’s bank to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p>If you and the customer have reached a resolution, also contact your ACH processor for further instructions to close out the case and refund any chargeback fees.
