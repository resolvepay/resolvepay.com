Cash flow loan</h3>\n<p>Also known as short-term loans or fixed-rate loans, you receive the loan in a lump sum. The borrower will make regular fixed installments within a short period.</p>\n<p>The cash flow loan is similar to installment loans, but the key difference is you pay fixed fees in this arrangement, unlike in installment loans where you make interest income payments.</p>\n<p>Like the installment loan, the qualification requirements for a fixed-rate loan are not as stringent as mid-term or long-term loans, which is great for start-ups and small businesses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"f-merchant-cash-advance\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#f-merchant-cash-advance\" aria-label=\"f merchant cash advance permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>f. Merchant cash advance</h3>\n<p>One of the quickest ways to obtain funding is through a merchant cash advance (MCAs). You won’t have to jump through hoops to acquire one, and the lender will release the cash fast.</p>\n<p>MCAs are short-term financing programs where the lender sends upfront funds to the applicant, pegged on future sales by the borrower. The lender expects daily or weekly repayments until the borrower settles the advance and fees in full.</p>\n<p>MCAs have the most flexible qualifications requirements of all working capital financing options, even when you have bad credit. Cash disbursement is typically within a day of loan approval.</p>\n<h3 id=\"g-invoice-financingfactoring-or-accounts-receivable-financing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#g-invoice-financingfactoring-or-accounts-receivable-financing\" aria-label=\"g invoice financingfactoring or accounts receivable financing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>g.

Seasonal demand</h3>\n<p>Some industries go through seasonality, meaning they do not have predictable revenues throughout the year. Besides that, you may find that business is booming, but you still do not have asset liquidity or cash at hand to handle operational costs.</p>\n<p>For instance, the manufacturing industry’s production and sales correspond with retailer’s needs, and most retailers have the most sales during the holiday season in the fourth quarter.</p>\n<p>As such, manufacturers produce goods during the summer in preparation to supply retailers during the fourth quarter. Therefore, manufacturers will typically slow down manufacturing purchases during the festive season as they concentrate on selling inventory, significantly reducing manufacturing sales.</p>\n<p>Manufacturing companies that face such cyclical sales will have to acquire working capital loans during such periods to cover the shortfall and help them power through the periods with minimal business activity. They usually repay the loans during the busy season.</p>\n<h3 id=\"b-for-growth\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#b-for-growth\" aria-label=\"b for growth permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>b.

Benefits of working capital loan</h3>\n<p><strong>You don’t always need collateral:</strong> generally, there are two types of loans. Most lenders will extend unsecured working capital loan terms to borrowers with solid credit scores and strong financial histories as it indicates negligible credit risk. The lender will offer these terms to small business owners if they meet the criteria.</p>\n<p>If your business qualifies for an unsecured working capital loan, you won’t have to provide collateral of any kind, be it your inventory, current assets, invoices, or the business. However, they have punitive penalties in case you default.</p>\n<p><strong>Straightforward application process:</strong> compared to traditional loans that require you to fill in lots of paperwork, applying for a working capital loan is not as stressful. Further, you don’t have to provide a ton of documents, sufficient collateral, or face a lengthy wait for the approval process, and yet there are no guarantees that the lender will approve the loan.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to go through such hassles as the application process for the working capital loan is available online. Neither do you face the lengthy approval time before accessing funds.</p>\n<p>Online working capital loans are a great option because the lender will mostly approve your application within a few days, and release cash within a few hours of loan approval.</p>\n<p>You are prepared to handle opportunities or challenges: whenever a financial issue arises, a working capital solution can help settle the bill, eliminating late payments to creditors and hurting credit ratings.</p>\n<p>A timely infusion of cash through a working capital loan can ease the financial pressure and reduce the higher rates a business faces whenever they have bad credit ratings.</p>\n<p><strong>Maintain ownership:</strong> some forms of financing would require you to give up chunks of your business and control over decision-making, such as equity financing.</p>\n<p>If you take money from a financial institution offering a working capital loan, all they require from you is the monthly payments. Run the business the way you see fit, without interference.</p>\n<h3 id=\"b-cons-of-working-capital-loan\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#b-cons-of-working-capital-loan\" aria-label=\"b cons of working capital loan permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>b.
