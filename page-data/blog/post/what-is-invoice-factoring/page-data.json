Unlike a business loan, invoice factoring helps businesses get paid faster with money that customers already owe to the business. Invoice factoring is typically provided by third-party lenders or independent finance providers (a factor or “factoring company”), but it can also be provided by banks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-invoice-financing-work\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-does-invoice-financing-work\" aria-label=\"how does invoice financing work permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How does invoice financing work?</h2>\n<p>When a business “factors” an invoice, it sells the unpaid invoice to a third-party factoring service. The factoring service “advances” the business a portion of the total invoice value (usually 70-90%) upfront and holds onto the rest. Once a customer pays the factoring company for the outstanding invoice, the factoring company deducts its fees and sends the remaining balance on the invoice to the business's bank account.</p>\n<h5 id=\"heres-a-step-by-step-overview-of-the-factoring-process\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#heres-a-step-by-step-overview-of-the-factoring-process\" aria-label=\"heres a step by step overview of the factoring process permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Here's a step-by-step overview of the factoring process:</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>A business sells goods or services to a customer.</li>\n<li>The business offers the customer net terms (e.g. 30, 60, or 90 days to pay).

At face value, that might seem like a bargain. However, factoring costs can also include processing fees, application fees, monthly minimum fees, and other payment terms hidden in the fine print. So it can be difficult to calculate how much invoice factoring costs your business over time.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say you factor a $10,000 invoice and your customer takes four weeks to pay. A factoring service would pay you 80% of the invoice upfront (an $8,000 cash advance) and hold onto 20% of the invoice (a $2000 reserve) until the client pays the invoice.</p>\n<p>The total cost of factoring that invoice could include any of the following fees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A flat-fee factor rate. A 4% flat-fee factor rate works out to $400.</li>\n<li>A per-week fee to factor that invoice. A 2% factor rate works out to $400 per week until your customer pays up.</li>\n<li>Processing fees. A 3% processing fee is $300.</li>\n<li>Payment fees. Want to receive your cash advances from the invoice factoring service via ACH? There are fees for that, too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you add up a 3% processing fee ($300), a 2% per-week factor rate ($200 x 4 weeks = $800), ACH payment fees ($10), you’d end up paying $1110 in factoring fees in this scenario—meaning you’d be losing out on a whopping 11% of the invoice’s total value.</p>\n<p>Factoring fees aren’t standardized. Factoring service fees can be higher if your customers are deemed “high risk” or take longer to pay. So do your research, read the fine print, and make sure you know the true impact that invoice factoring will have on your business's bank account and bottom line before you sign up with a factoring service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-a-business-qualify-for-invoice-factoring\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-does-a-business-qualify-for-invoice-factoring\" aria-label=\"how does a business qualify for invoice factoring permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How does a business qualify for invoice factoring?</h2>\n<p>To qualify for invoice factoring, a business generally needs to meet the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Commercial invoices.</strong> Because factoring requires the sale of invoices to commercial Factored invoices must be commercial, meaning that consumer-based invoices generally won’t qualify for invoice factoring.</li>\n<li><strong>B2B or B2G.</strong> The business must work with business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-government (B2G) customers.</li>\n<li><strong>Creditworthy customers.</strong> The business’s customers must be creditworthy.

Customers no longer send payments to the business. Instead, they send them to the factor. How well the factor handles payment collections (think customer service) can impact your business relationships.</li>\n<li><strong>Red flag to your customers.</strong> Using a factor can also send a negative message to customers that your business is struggling. If invoice factoring gives the impression that your company is weak or that it might be going out of business soon, customers will work with your competitors to strengthen their supply chain and reduce risk.</li>\n<li><strong>It's time-consuming.</strong> Factoring services have an invoice-by-invoice application process. Which means you need to upload every single invoice you'd like to factor and wait for a decision from the factoring service each time you want to know your approved advance rate and get paid faster on a net terms invoice. This might be okay if your invoicing volume is low. But when you invoicing hundreds of customers a month, the process doesn't scale well.</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly minimums.</strong> Most invoice factoring contracts require a monthly minimum to be factored because the fewer the invoices, the higher the operational expenses will be for the invoice factoring company. Typically these minimums are established at the beginning of the relationship considering highly achievable targets. A higher minimum should lower the offered invoice factoring discount.</li>\n<li><strong>Huge fees.</strong> Factoring fees are high.

Faster access to working capital can have a huge impact on a business’s ability to survive. And the immediate cash injection that invoice factoring provides can be exactly what a struggling company needs to remain operational.</p>\n<p>However, companies typically stop using invoice factoring once that immediate cash-flow problem is solved. So if a business is using invoice factoring as standard practice, it usually indicates that there’s a systemic issue in the company. Invoice net terms, inventories, or accounts receivable processes likely need to be adjusted to stabilize cash flow and ensure that the company has enough money to operate.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/x72jfbsnccq4/6OAd6WTONPepORgJXMwP1V/3a8893bf1f60c0ed63f550ef516c844d/AdobeStock_118420184.jpeg\" alt=\"guy on the phone looking at receipt\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"should-your-business-use-invoice-factoring\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#should-your-business-use-invoice-factoring\" aria-label=\"should your business use invoice factoring permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Should your business use invoice factoring?</h2>\n<p>Every company is different, so there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.
