What's your short-term liquidity like? How are the company's current assets looking? We'll help you answer these questions and more. The working capital formula (or working capital ratio) is made of liquid funds/assets that can be used for daily operations. It is the difference between the current ratio of current assets and current liabilities and a measure of a company’s liquidity or cash equivalents.</p>\n<p>However, one of the main things that can reduce a company's working capital cash flow is their net terms invoices. That means all the invoices that you're waiting for your customers to pay. If you're a manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler - chances are you simply have to offer 30, 60, or even 90-day net terms or payment terms to your business customers. Find out how products like <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/\">Resolve Pay</a> can unlock cash flow and reduce this net terms invoice risk. </p>\n<p>Once you know your cash flow, check out Resolve's <a href=\"https://resolvepay.com/cash-flow-calculator/\">Cash Flow Calculator</a>.

The following formula is used to calculate working capital:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Net working capital = current assets - current liabilities</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, it is simply the difference between current assets and liabilities. Since working capital is dependent on current assets and liabilities, this also means it is “current.” In other words, working capital is always dealing with a short-term time frame. </p>\n<p>Working capital is immediate cash to meet the immediate obligations of day to day operations. Immediate obligations never go away and must be handled daily. This is why cash flow is called the lifeblood of a business. You can't depend on fixed assets. Without cash flow, a business will quickly seize up and cease to exist. Working capital is dependent on cash flow. It’s cash flow that fills the coffers of working capital. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-resolve-help-with-cash-flow\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-does-resolve-help-with-cash-flow\" aria-label=\"how does resolve help with cash flow permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How does Resolve help with cash flow?</h2>\n<p>Chances are you are producing finished goods from raw materials and selling them to other businesses.

(and how it affects business operations)</h2>\n<p>Turns out businesses need free cash flow, and you don't want to depend on short-term loans. Any business that wants to grow and build out a network of suppliers needs working capital. It allows a business to pay for short-term expenses. It is also used by suppliers to evaluate the financial health of a business. Suppliers want to ensure that they are dealing with a reliable business and that they’ll get paid on time. Analyzing a potential customer’s working capital provides the necessary insights into the efficiency of a business. Of course, further analysis is needed to determine overall creditworthiness. Let's get into the working capital calculations. </p>\n<h3 id=\"credit\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#credit\" aria-label=\"credit permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Credit</h3>\n<p>This doesn't mean credit cards. Companies with net positive working capital can more easily obtain credit than those with negative working capital. Some suppliers will go further than determining if a business has only positive working capital. The amount of working capital is also factored into how much credit a company will receive. This is generally determined using an average working capital that is based on industry and company size.</p>\n<h3 id=\"suppliers\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#suppliers\" aria-label=\"suppliers permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Suppliers</h3>\n<p>It’s also easier to find suppliers when a company has net positive working capital.

While working capital is mostly used for short-term needs, as a company grows and is able to consistently build up its working capital, more money is available to help with its expansionary needs. Working capital that goes beyond what is required for short-term obligations can be used to help grow the company. In some cases, when a company has enough working capital, it can forego loans in place of its available cash.</p>\n<p>Working capital shouldn’t be confused with cash. Cash is a component of working capital and there is no minimum or maximum cash percentage. Some companies may have a lot of working capital but very little cash. This would mean they have more short-term non-cash assets. If the company needs cash, it would have to convert these assets into cash, which shouldn’t be a problem since they are liquid assets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-companies-need-to-track-their-working-capital--cash-flow\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-companies-need-to-track-their-working-capital--cash-flow\" aria-label=\"why companies need to track their working capital  cash flow permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why companies need to track their working capital &#x26; cash flow</h2>\n<p>Working capital is both a performance metric and a key indicator. The efficiency of a business can be tracked by changes in the trend of its working capital. Increasing working capital may be a sign of dropping expenses or increased cash flow. Decreasing working capital can mean short-term liabilities are overtaking short-term assets. As well, since working capital is necessary for a business to operate, it’s always important to understand what this indicator is saying.</p>\n<h3 id=\"determine-cash-flow\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#determine-cash-flow\" aria-label=\"determine cash flow permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Determine cash flow</h3>\n<p>Cash flow is a critical part of a business's financial health, and tracking working capital helps you understand cash flow. As mentioned earlier, cash flow is the lifeblood of any business and the source of working capital. Understanding the trend of cash flow will help determine future working capital.

A business that isn't producing cash flow can still have working capital. However, it will be diminishing every month. Diminishing or deficient working capital signifies that cash flows are absent or current liabilities are eating up all working capital. Both are adverse scenarios.</p>\n<p>Understanding the trend in working capital provides feedback about how efficiently a business is performing. A quick drop in working capital might be explained by money shifting to expansion projects, which is a net positive for the business. If the drop were due to an increase in debt services, that would indicate the business is running poorly — working capital is being rapidly depleted for non-productive use (i.e., loan payments).</p>\n<p>A company that is able to sustain a consistent level of working capital shows that it has good cash flow and is in control of its expenses. There’s money remaining for expansion as well. As with many business performance metrics, following the trend over a period of time can help to reveal potential trouble or that the business is improving.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conduct-risk-analysis\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conduct-risk-analysis\" aria-label=\"conduct risk analysis permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conduct risk analysis</h3>\n<p>Higher working capital typically means less risk. This is because working capital can act as a cushion against unforeseen expenses. This scenario is especially helpful for companies that don't have access to credit. For those companies, building up above-average working capital will help to offset financial shocks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"expand-into-new-markets-or-develop-new-products\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#expand-into-new-markets-or-develop-new-products\" aria-label=\"expand into new markets or develop new products permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Expand into new markets or develop new products</h3>\n<p>If you want to expand your business, you’ll likely need working capital or access to credit. This is similar to buying a home. Most people who want to buy a home can only afford a down payment. The balance is provided by a loan (i.e., mortgage). Similarly, businesses that want to expand need access to far more funds than they have available. </p>\n<p>While a company’s working capital may not be enough to pay for expansion, it can help the company to get a loan. Lenders will evaluate a company’s working capital as a main lending decision factor. The better maintained a company’s working capital is, the more likely the company is to get approved for a loan and the more loan it is likely to get.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Everyone needs healthy cash flow.

Without working capital, a business isn’t able to pay for its short-term financial obligations, gain access to credit, or get approved for loans. No working capital can be a sign that short-term liabilities are unsustainable. Working capital is fed by cash flow, which means positive cash flow is required to maintain working capital.
